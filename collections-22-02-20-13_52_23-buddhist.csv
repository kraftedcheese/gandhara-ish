This cloth was designed to appeal to Chinese devotees, reflecting the international visitorship of the monastery.","According to a traditional story, the bronze Phra Chinarat image was cast at the initiative of King Thammatraipidok (thought by some historians to be King Mahathammaracha of Sukhothai, r. 1346/7-1368/74), the founder of Phitsanulok. The king had craftsmen from the cities of Si Sachanalai, Sawakhalok, Chiang Saen, and Hariphunchai together create three bronze Buddha images. Two statues were successfully cast; these were Phra Chinasi and Phra Sisatda. The third, Phra Chinarat, was not. The craftsmen tried three times but failed; the king then made a solemn resolution requesting the help of the gods. The god Indra therefore descended from heaven in the guise of a white-robed ascetic and helped the craftsmen successfully complete the casting.  
The Phra Chinarat Buddha statue at Phitsanulok is one of the most popular Buddha images in Thailand and has long been considered to be an especially beautiful statue of the Buddha. King Rama V (r. 1868-1910) wrote that “there is no finding a Buddha image as beautiful as Phra Phuttha Chinarat.” The statue’s likeness adorns many votive objects, including popular prints (see for example object no. 1991,1022,0.27). This cloth yantra or magical diagram aims to invoke the protection and beneficence of the famous statue.

This type of lotus-petal base with beading is found in Sino-Tibetan Buddhist sculpture of the Yongle era.

The Yongle emperor maintained good diplomatic relations with the Tibetans and invited Tibetan religious leaders including Halima to court to perform religious services for his deceased parents, for example, in 1407.
These architectural elements were probably made for the base section of an ornamental gate at the 'Da Bao'en si', Nanjing, and may be compared to a reconstruction of the main gate illustrated in a recent exhibition catalogue. Construction of the 'Da Bao'en si' temple complex began in the Yongle reign in 1412 and was completed in the Xuande era in 1431.

The textile is white twill damask showing half of a lion over 40 cm long, with only the head and tail still visible. This design was previously misinterpreted by Stein as a floral pattern, and Roderick Whitfield as phoenixes. The lion may be in a crouching or walking position, as seen in a paper painting found in Cave 17. There is a small pattern to the left of the lion, probably a stone, and another opposite the head, and symmetrically repeated along the warp direction. However, there is no woven pattern where the lion’s body should be, indicating that this is probably the beginning of the fabric. There is a similar banner head in the V&A loan collection: a similar image of the Buddha is painted on a different woven damask image of the lion (LOAN:STEIN.490). On the basis of the style of the painting, Roderick Whitfield dated this piece to the Five Dynasties.

From Whitfield 1982:
This banner is the most impressive of the three (Pls. 46-48). The Bodhisattva, holding a small vajra in his right hand, faces the spectator squarely. The left hand, palm outwards, seems to caress one of the curving lotus stems at his side. Above him, instead of the hanging textile drape of the other banners, is a splendid floral border. His striped dhoti is smoothly wrapped around each leg, and a white-flowered scarf is tied in a generous knot on the right hip. The colour of his body is a greenish bronze. His eyes, quite horizontal, are almond-shaped, bright white with black pupils. This feature above all gives the figure its Indianizing appearance, and one might make the comparison with bronze figures with the eyes inlaid in silver (see, for instance, the eighth-century bronze Buddha from Phyang monastery, Ladakh, reproduced in Singh, 1968,p.53). Bright white is also used for the yajñopavīta, or sacrificial thread worn by the Bodhisattva-in sculpture these too on occasion may have been inlaid in silver. Such features support the theory that this group of paintings may be related to the art of Khotan. 
All three of these banners and presumably those in New Delhi from the same group differ in construction from the rest of the Dunhuang banners. They are on a grey silk with a balanced close weave, while the majority of the paintings are on a more open silk, with warp threads running in pairs. They are also much narrower than the usual width of the other banners, and both edges are hemmed with a strip of silk binding, instead of being merely painted with a dark brown pigment as is commonly seen. Finally, all three of these banners show a selvedge on the lower end. These facts seem to imply a different origin for the silk itself, and a different tradition of making the banners, the figures being at a right angle to the warp instead of in line with it. It does therefore seem possible, from technical as well as stylistic evidence, that these paintings were executed elsewhere and brought to Dunhuang, rather than being executed there under the influence of models from further west. It is very noticeable that none of the banners (including the group in New Delhi) has a cartouche for characters, even those that are in fact inscribed in Tibetan.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1982:
此幡是同一系列的三件（圖46～48）中給人印象最深的作品。右手上放著小形的金剛杵，面向正前方。左手掌向前，手指執旁邊的蓮華莖。上方不像其他幡的幕，而是描繪著精美花紋的邊飾。從腰到腳的部分順滑的纏繞著細軟的布，身著布滿小花紋的天衣，鬆軟的繋在腰的右方。身軀被塗成青銅色，眼睛扁長呈杏仁形，純白眼底點著黑瞳。這種眼睛的表現方式更是印度式，可以與眼部嵌銀的金銅像（如，參照M.Singh;Himalayan Art.London,1968.p.53收錄的Phyang寺的8世紀金銅像）做比較。而且不僅是眼部，有的菩薩裝飾帶也是白色的，在雕刻作品中用嵌銀來表現那些部分也有很多例子。這種特徵成爲這一連貫的繪畫與和闐美術有關聯的有力證據。
在新德里國立博物館的同一系列的幡恐怕也是那樣的，這三件幡的製作不同于敦煌其他幡。這三件採用經緯均勻質地細密的鼠灰色絹，而其他大部分的幡則採用只有兩根經線質地粗糙的絹。絹幅遠比其他幡狹窄。幡兩端的邊兒通常只是用黑褐色顔料繪出，而這三件則用細絹布縫的。而且此三件幡的任何一件，布的織邊在畫的下端。以上的不同點說明，不僅絹的生産地不同，幡的製作習慣也不同，菩薩像不是沿著經線，而是和經線成直角。因此，無論風格上還是技法上，與其說這三件幡是在敦煌受西方影響時製作的，還不如說在其他某一地方製作，帶到敦煌更爲妥當。這些一連竄的幡中（包括收藏在新德里國立博物館的），雖然有吐蕃文的記錄，但無一例有長方形題箋，這也是值得注意的。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1982 / Paintings from Dunhuang; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

MAS.876 has two confronting geese and a quarter of a roundel; MAS.877 has only half a goose but a larger area of quatrefoil, and one selvedge, 0.3 cm wide. By placing the two pieces together, Stein was able to reconstruct the pattern. It consists of two motifs: a dominant large roundel with encircled rosettes and a narrower inner roundel, enclosing four paired geese; and a four-petalled flower in the centre, and the other secondary quatrefoil. The repeat in the warp direction is about 56.6 cm but it is unclear in the weft direction.
The textile was dyed with two colours: orange for the geese, flowers and quatrefoil, and blue for the ground, the large roundel, the little pearl roundel and the leaves inside the roundel. Some green leaves of the quatrefoil were made by painting a yellow colour on the blue leaves. Another fragment from the same textile (but without geese) is in the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg (Дх51).

MAS.876 has two confronting geese and a quarter of a roundel; MAS.877 has only half a goose but a larger area of quatrefoil, and one selvedge, 0.3 cm wide. By placing the two pieces together, Stein was able to reconstruct the pattern. It consists of two motifs: a dominant large roundel with encircled rosettes and a narrower inner roundel, enclosing four paired geese; and a four-petalled flower in the centre, and the other secondary quatrefoil. The repeat in the warp direction is about 56.6 cm but it is unclear in the weft direction.
The textile was dyed with two colours: orange for the geese, flowers and quatrefoil, and blue for the ground, the large roundel, the little pearl roundel and the leaves inside the roundel. Some green leaves of the quatrefoil were made by painting a yellow colour on the blue leaves. Another fragment from the same textile (but without geese) is in the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg (Дх51).

His face is long, the chin a little pointed, the eyes rounded and prominent. On the Bodhisattva's left the standing figure with hands cupped and joined as if holding something, wearing a turban with a globular ornament in the crest, earrings, collar and necklace, uttarīya and paridhāna, appears to be Indra. On the Bodhisattva's far right a damaged standing male figure, whose feet appear shod, wears the uttarīya in the wide mode, earrings, a large chignon on the back of his head and an offering in his cupped left hand with bracelet; the right arm is almost lost. The framing pilasters, continued on the sides, have a recessed oblong panel with curved top and bottom on the shaft, a two-tier Corinthian capital with pronounced volutes and abacus and the usual base; above is a sawtooth cornice and on the sides are indications of a palmette.

Among the groups with a Bodhisattva flanked by Brahmā and Indra or other figures he sees as representing the Instigation (saṃcodana) of Siddhārtha to abandon the secular life, Foucher specifies this panel as an example, explaining the water pot as symbolising the Bodhisattva's spiritual intentions, although it does not occur on all the examples he proposes for this subject.

We ought to give to all.  Food ought to be give to the laborers who are virtuous. Three-fold gain should be given to the speaker of truth.  Place is not to be give to the disputer of Buddhism.  Two-fold gain should be given to the teacher of religion. To the good king tribute must be paid monthly with flowers and perfumes, and on the full mooon in the month Vaishakha he ought in particular to be presented with the jar.  My virtue and that of my ancestors is for the salvation of murderers of husbands, murderers of fathers, and murderers of friends, and of those who have committed great sins against the gods and brahmans. The kings that do not regard this kingdom preserving religion of Buddha, shall by it be cut off with all their family and perish in a flaming fire.  May this very excellent religion of the people resembling a tree, remain in heaven for ever, and may people in all directins through its remaining, be happy as long as the sea continues to be agitated by marine monsters..."".

The 'tengai' hangs above the heads of prominent images in temples. It probably originated as a sunshade used by the nobility, and as such occurs in the earliest representations of the Buddha in India.; Zwalf 1985
The Japanese canopy, or ‘tengai’, derives from the Indian royal parasol placed above the Buddha and other figures in sculpture and painting; Central Asian fragments in textile have been found at Dunhuang. In Japan it hangs from temple ceilings over Buddha and Bodhisattva images. Usually of painted wood in a metal frame, it can be carved with elaborate openwork.

At Amarāvatī carved slabs covered the 'stūpa' drum along the processional path where worshippers could see events from the Buddha's life and representations of the 'stūpa' itself. This drum slab shows the 'stūpa' in an elaborate form. The railing pierced by an entrance surmounted by lions obscures all but the tops of the drum slabs. The first visible register represents the drum coping; a rectangular projection with pillars occurs at the cardinal points. Two are visible at the sides with lions on the corresponding gateways. Above the drum coping are huge dome panels with crowded scenes. In fact, the drum platform projected 3.7m around the dome; no stairway is depicted and none was revealed in the excavations. Above the dome panels are registers with running animals, pots of plenty and undulating garlands which mark the beginning of the curvature; above are narrative roundels set in elaborate swags. Crowning the monument, a rectangular railing encloses a pillar and parasols. All the space beside it is filled by a dense composition of jubilant deities, one of whom is playing the flute. The scene visible in the gateway represents the Buddha, after the Enlightenment, sheltered from a storm by the serpent-spirit Mucalinda. Before him are worshippers; others flanking the gate include standing, sitting and dwarfish figures carrying offerings. The sheltering of the Buddha by Mucalinda was a little-used motif in India but became popular in Southeast Asia. There is no evidence, however, for images or panels of this apparent size below the pillared platforms, whose function is obscure. The railing of the processional path consists of uprights, a coping and crossbars with prominent lotus roundels, and projecting on both sides of the gateway are the tops of pillars standing in the processional path.
However inaccurate it may be in minor or even major features, this slab shows the splendour of an eastern Deccani 'stūpa' at its most ornate.; Bibliography:

This type of Buddha image - crowned and dressed in royal costume -represents a special Southeast Asian development of the iconography of the Buddha. This was nowhere more popular than in Burma especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Several elements have probably combined to produce this type, including the eastern Indian icon of the crowned Buddha, which was understood in Mahayana Buddhism to represent a cosmic lord, and the royal ancestry of prince Siddhartha. In Southeast Asia, crowned images came to indicate the Buddha's supreme spirituality. Crowned images of the Buddha are known from Pagan where the influence of Bengal and non-Theravada Buddhism was clearly substantial. In Burma, such images became particularly popular between the 16th and 18th centuries.
Crowned images may also be connected with the legend of Jambupati. This legend is unknown in India, but records the humbling of a boastful king, Jambupati, by the Buddha. The story tells how the Buddha has Jambupati brought before him having first transformed himself into a mighty king, set in an incomparable palace. Witnessing the Buddha in all his majesty, Jambupati accepts the 'dharma' and becomes a monk. 
 
While the 'bhumisparshamudra' gesture is one of the most popular in all Burmese sculptures of the Buddha, it does here seem to have a special link with the story of Jambupati, as the Buddha, through this gesture, makes Jambupati witness the truth of the 'dharma', just as in the story of Mara.

King Pasenadi of Kosala, a great supporter of the Buddha, created the first image of the Buddha by having a portrait statue carved of sandalwood. When the Buddha went to view this image, it started to rise from its seat to show its respect. The Buddha however forbid the statue from getting up, declaring that after his death the image would represent him and carry on his teachings.

This sculpture illustrates a story in which the Buddha and Shiva (called Mahisuanthep or Phra Isuan in Thai) played a game of hide-and-seek. First, Shiva hid 100,000 layers deep underground. The Buddha, having extraordinary powers of sight, quickly found him. Then it was the Buddha’s turn to hide. He magically shrank himself and stood above Shiva’s eyes. The god searched in every corner in all of the worlds of the entire universe but could not find the Buddha. The Buddha revealed himself by descending from a magnificent staircase made of seven kinds of jewels which he magically created.  He preached to Shiva, causing a feeling of great faith and joy to arise in the god. Shiva built a beautiful shrine to the Buddha after the Buddha’s parinirvana or death. This story appears in two Pali texts known in Thailand, the Lokapannati and the Trailokavinicchayakatha.  
There is a similar sculpture of a small Buddha figure atop a god riding a bull in the collection of the National Museum of Bangkok.  It is also dated to the 19th century. In addition, there is a similar representation displayed in the cloister of Phra Pathom Chedi in Nakhon Pathom, where it is the 56th of 80 statues of the Buddha in different postures dedicated in 1983-84. In this cloister, the sculpture is described as illustrating a different story than the one recounted above. This story, from the Baka Brahma Sutta, relates the encounter between the Buddha and a deity, Baka Brahma. Baka Brahma believed himself to be indomitable, immune from the workings of karma. To show his power, he magically concealed his body. He was easily found by the Buddha. Then the Buddha hid by standing on the head of Baka Brahma, who was unable to find him. The Buddha then gave teachings to Baka Brahma, who renounced his previous beliefs and advanced on the path to enlightenment. This story is quite similar to the one involving Shiva. One may argue that the sculpture seems more likely to depict Shiva than Baka Brahma, however, as the god holds a trident and rides a bull, both features which are characteristic of depictions of Shiva. Also, the similar sculpture in the National Museum of Bangkok bears an inscription referring to the Buddha standing on Shiva.  
It is notable that the British Museum’s sculpture has a base illustrating another narrative scene. At the center is a herd of running deer. To either side they are watched by a tiger crouched behind bushes.  This scene apparently evokes the fact that the representation of the Buddha standing on the defeated Baka Brahma/Shiva is meant to be especially venerated by those born in the year of the tiger.

King Pasenadi of Kosala, a great supporter of the Buddha, created the first image of the Buddha by having a portrait statue carved of sandalwood. When the Buddha went to view this image, it started to rise from its seat to show its respect. The Buddha however forbade the statue from getting up, declaring that after his death the image would represent him and carry on his teachings.

This image of the crowned Buddha represents a quite different ideal from the serene dry-lacquer Buddha image which summed up the aesthetic of the Burmese court. Remarkably, the body is treated as if made up of a series of dramatically abutting planes - the smooth, svelte character of the sophisticated images of the court are far removed. The message of this Buddha image seems to be power and riotous pattern, not composure.
The dramatic scrollwork features attached to the sides of the crown are seen on Buddha images from the late Pagan period onwards. 
It cannot be proved now, but this sculpture probably entered the British Museum from the India Museum of the East India Company which was disbanded in 1880. There is a certain internal logic to this suggestion as Lower Burma came under British control earliest, Tenasserim in 1826 and the delta region in 1852. A provenance from the Moulmein/Martaban area would thus be compatible with an East India Company acquisition.
Although much more sophisticated, an ivory sculpture in the British Museum, BM 1993.0724.1, is iconographically very close.

Isaacs and Blurton 2000:
The serene face of this standing Buddha image is typical of the last school of sculpture in royal Burma. It is associated especially with Mandalay, the capital of the last two kings, Mindon (1853-78) and Thibaw (1878-85). Indeed, this style is still in use for marble sculptures of the Buddha in the workshops of Tampawaddy, in the southern outskirts of the city.
Originally this sculpture must have been covered in gold leaf which would have been laid on to the surface using lacquer. Fragments of the gilding still remain all over, but particularly on the edge of the robe.
A large number of sculptures of this type have survived in museum collections, though few as fine as this. Intriguingly, this sculpture once belonged to Sir Richard Carnac Temple before it entered the collections of the Museum in 1923. How this great scholar/administrator came by it is unknown, other than that it was acquired in Hsenwi in the northern Shan States. Temple's remarkable collection, which was located in his family house, The Nash, in Kempsey, Worcestershire, was sold in December 1922. The sale included material not only from Burma but also from India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands where he also served. The collections were regrettably dispersed, although a few items can still be identified in museum collections. This sculpture of the Buddha may have been bought at The Nash sale by the British Museum, as from its museum registration number we know that it was in Bloomsbury in January 1923 (i.e. the next month). The Museum's records only state that it was purchased from Knight, Frank and Rutley in London, though it was these auctioneers who carried out the sale at The Nash.
The disparity between Mandalay - where the sculpture was surely made - and Hsenwi - where it was acquired - is not as remarkable as it sounds. Mandalay, throughout the second half of the nineteenth century, was the royal centre, and all tributary chiefs, such as those in the Shan States, would have travelled there and been in contact with it. The acquisition of a large Buddha image from Mandalay, in the latest style and for transport back to the remote hills on the Burmese-Chinese border, is entirely understandable within this context. Mandalay, to this day, remains the religious and cultural centre of Burma.",Isaacs & Blurton 2000 / Visions from the Golden Land.

Unlike the sometimes fantastic Gandharan narrative scenes where the Buddha is assaulted by the rejected Māra's army of monsters, this Sārnāth representation is more an icon with dominant central cult figure. Instead of the heavy-lidded Sārnāth introspection there is here an apt, if serene, awareness of triumph as monsters hover over the Buddha while Māra and a daughter stand beside him.

He miraculously enabled heaven, the earth and hell to be revealed, such that the gods, humans, demons, hell-beings and other creatures in all of these places were able to see each other. The Buddha is said to have raised his arms upwards to show heaven, to have raised them midway to show the earth, and lowered them to show hell. Only the last of these seems to ever be illustrated, however.

The figure was made by constructing a wooden armature over which cloth was arranged in the appropriate shape. The assemblage was lacquered.

While there he formed a high opinion of the Burmese, especially of their war-, and navigation-skills and later wrote admiringly about them and of his experiences there.  While in Burma he acquired a huge collection of artefacts which, on his return he offered to the British Museum as a gift, on condition that he - like other major donors of the period - was made a Life Trustee and that the trusteeship should pass down through his family (vide Townley).  The Trustees declined his offer, possibly for class reasons. His collection was, the next year, displayed at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly where it was reported on.  Later, parts of it were also displayed at the RAS where it was described by the diarist the Revd. John Skinner (illustrated manuscript now in the British Library).  The collection included the State Carriage of the King of Burma (captured in Tenasserim) as well as a massive royal throne; both these two items are illustrated in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.  The collection was also extremely rich in Buddha images as well as weapons - amongst much else.  Sadly, knowledge of the whereabouts of the collection has been los.  A complete list of the collection survives in the British Museum Archive. Marryat’s collecting is of interest intellectually as it was on both a grand and an encyclopaedic scale.  He responded to the opportunity – he was amongst the very first Englishmen to do so in Burma – to try to understand a newly encountered part of the world through that country’s material record.  He was rare in his time in that he acknowledged the equal or even superior quality of the Burmese in certain areas of life.  Marryat’s writings and his collecting both indicate a sensibility akin to that of Stamford Raffles and Edward Moor whose collections from South and Southeast Asia are also highlighted in the King’s Library.; Isaacs and Blurton 2000:
Hollow lacquer sculptures of this size are most unusual, especially in collections outside Burma. The sculpture has a remarkable history as it has been in the British Museum since immediately after the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1825. Captain Marryat, who donated the sculpture to the Museum, took part in the war, most of which was fought in Lower Burma (hence the suggested provenance for the sculpture). In later years he wrote a number of books, including a volume of reminiscences of his time in Burma. However, there is no record of this extraordinary image in those writings, and by the time he displayed his other Burmese antiquities to the public in 1827, this image was already in old Montagu House, the building that functioned as the museum prior to construction of the present building in the 1830s and 1840s. In that first building the sculpture was to be seen on the main staircase, close to the giraffes! It is described in the Museum's Book of Presents as 'A Colossal Figure of Gaudma, a Burmese deity from Rangoon'. It is difficult to assess the importance of the provenance provided here as anything brought out of Burma after the campaign would have come 'from Rangoon'.
There has been some discussion as to the meaning of its iconography, and in connection with another sculpture where the Buddha holds a similar fruit, Zwalf has drawn attention to the fact that the myrobalan fruit has medicinal properties, that the 'Buddha as healer is an old and widespread concept...' and that 'the ""historical"" Buddha is also recorded as having received a myrobalan fruit from the god Indra after the Enlightenment. The way in which the fruit appears as if being proffered to the devotee inclines the present authors to the first explanation, but there is no categoric evidence to support this.
The scalloped edge to the robe is also seen in a smaller dry-lacquer Buddha image in the Victoria and Albert Museum (IS 21 & A-1970) illustrated in Lowry 1974: 17.

Though 'Sikhi' is the name of one of the previous Buddhas, here Sikhi probably refers to a type or style of  Buddha image which provided the model on which the donor and craftsman based this sculpture. See also another Buddha image, FBInd.5.a, in the museum's collection. The name Sikhi appears in an old northern Thai legend dating to at least the 15th century which says that long ago, the Buddha Gotama during his lifetime visited the area which is today's Thailand. He sat upon a black rock and gave a sermon to the local inhabitants. Later, a king wishing to spread Buddhism had the rock carved up into five statues of the Buddha, which he then distributed to rulers in what is today Burma, Cambodia and Thailand. These images were called 'Buddha Sikhi' statues. See a version of this story in N.A. Jayawickrama, The Sheaf of Garlands of the Epochs of the Conqueror, Being a Translation of the Jinakālamālīpakaraṇaṁ of Ratanapañña Thera of Thailand (London, 1978). pp. 155-8.","In the old curatorial note, the image is called 'Pra Juhn', a Thai name which would be romanized today as 'phra yuen', meaning a standing Buddha image.
In the north of Thailand, where this image may have originated, the standing posture may signify the Buddha 'calling for rain' to end a drought. It may also represent the Buddha 'opening up the three worlds:' it is said that the Buddha once visited his mother in heaven and preached to her and to the gods; when he returned to the earth, he descended from heaven via stairs made of gold, silver and jewels. He miraculously enabled heaven, the earth and hell to be revealed, such that the gods, humans, demons, hell-beings and other creatures in all of these places were able to see each other. The Buddha is said to have raised his arms upwards to show heaven, to have raised them midway to show the earth, and lowered them to show hell. Only the last of these seems to ever be illustrated, however. 
See Carol Stratton, Buddhist Sculpture of Northern Thailand (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Books, 2004), p. 45.; The collector of this object was Carl Bock, a Norwegian naturalist who visited Siam and areas to the north of it from June or July 1881 until August 1882. His account of his travels was published in London in 1884 as Temples and Elephants: The Narrative of a Journey of Exploration Through Upper Siam and Lao (Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, & Rivington).
Bock spent time in what is now central Thailand, including in Bangkok, the capital of Siam, and the towns of Paknam, Ayutthaya, Petchaburi, Ratchaburi, Kanchanaburi, Kamphaeng Phet and Tak (Raheng). He also travelled in today’s northern Thailand, visiting places along the Ping and Kok rivers including Lampang, Lamphun, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Chiang Saen and Fang.  
In Bock’s book, he used the term “Lao” to refer to northern Thailand.  This use of “Lao” differs from the contemporary understanding of “Lao.” In the late 19th century, Thailand, or Siam as it was then known, did not have the national borders which it has today. The so-called “Lao” area visited by Bock along the Ping and Kok rivers was the kingdom of Lanna, then a tributary of the kingdom of Siam. The Siamese in Bangkok referred to the land and people of Lanna as Lao even though the people of Lanna did not regard themselves as Lao. The dominant group in Lanna was the Tai Yuan. There were also various Shan, Karen and mountain peoples as well as Burmese and Chinese. The Siamese and Lanna languages were not mutually comprehensible. The Siamese government at Bangkok began to extend greater administrative control over Lanna beginning in about 1870, and Lanna was not fully absorbed into Siam until the turn of the century.
Although Bock’s publication as well as the British Museum records of the late 19th century refer to many of Bock’s items as Lao, they are unlikely to signify the Lao people and country as understood today. The items he describes as “Lao” are most likely to be from the Tai Yuan culture. Some also came from other groups living in the areas visited by Bock such as Shan, Karen and Lahu. 
Items from the Bock collection include those produced by these groups as well as by the Siamese (Thai).",,Not on display,,,buddha,Representation of: Buddha (Śākyamuni/Shijiamouni/Shaka),,,,Bequeathed by: Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks,,,,,,,Asia,,FBInd.13.a,Miscellaneous number: AF.5; Miscellaneous number: FBInd.13,,,,FBInd13a

He is the teacher whether as a wandering monk, as in the earlier tradition, or as in the later, a divine figure preaching advanced doctrines at celestial gatherings. The half-closed eyes are those of withdrawn meditation, but the hands are active to bring his message to the world. The monastic garments typical of the Sārnāth school cling with simplicity to the body; the decorated throne anticipates the crowned and ornamented image which became increasingly common as a symbol of the transcendent Buddha.","Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Koezuka (1994) / Masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu Art from the British Museum; Pemberton 2002 / The Buddha; Griffiths, Revire and Sanyal 2013 / An Inscribed Bronze Sculpture of a Buddha in bhadrāsana at Museum Ranggawarsita in Semarang (Central Java, Indonesia) (historiography of bhadrāsana type); Bautze-Picron 2010 / The bejewelled Buddha from India to Burma: new considerations; Foucher 1900 / Etude sur l'Iconographie Bouddhique de l'Inde",On display (G33/od),"Exhibited:

Small devotional images were first made in porcelain at Jingdezhen in the Song dynasty (960-1280); an example is the figure of Avalokitesvara unearthed from a Song dynasty well in Changzhou, Jiangsu, in 1978. Small Song dynasty images of this type are often represented within a rocky grotto. The Bodhisattva Guanyin is the most common subject for sculpture with a qingbai glaze. Guanyin in India is worshipped as the male god Avalokiteśvara, but in China the deity gradually evolves into a compassionate female goddess who hears the cries of the world.
During the Yuan era larger porcelain images of both Buddhist and Daoist gods and goddesses were made at Jingdezhen. A damaged porcelain figure of a Daoist god, covered with a qingbai glaze, was recently excavated from Yuan remains at Luomaqiao, Jingdezhen. Dated qingbai glazed porcelain figures of Buddhist deities survive from the Yuan era, including an image of the Bodhisattva Guanyin in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas. This figure is dated with an ink inscription on the base reading second or third year of the Da De reign (ad 1298-9). Several other Yuan qingbai images of Bodhisattvas are in well-known public collections: for example, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the Reitberg Museum, Zurich; the Field Museum, Chicago; the Staatliche Porzellansammlung, Dresden; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Musee Guimet, Paris. In the Yuan period images of deities were also made at the Longquan kilns in Zhejiang province, combining biscuit decoration with thick bean coloured green glaze (see BM 1929.0114.1).
By contrast, however, porcelain images of the Buddha with a qingbai glaze are much rarer than figures of Bodhisattvas. Apart from the present British Museum example, there is another seated image of the Buddha in the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto. At least two other qingbai Buddhas, both exhibiting slightly different ritual hand gestures called mudra, are known from private collections. Ultimately the form of this Buddha derives from Sino-Tibetan sculpture in more precious media, such as bronze. Related Yuan figures are also known in wood, including a lacquered wood figure of the Maitreya Buddha in the British Museum.",Harrison-Hall 2001 / Catalogue of Late Yuan and Ming Ceramics in the British Museum,Not on display,,,buddha,Representation of: Buddha,,,,Purchased from: Spink & Son Ltd,,,,1985,"Bought at Sotherbys 18/06/1985, lot 127, price includes Sotherby's commission and Spink's commission.",,Asia,,"1985,0717.1",,,,,198507171
146,,figure,"No: 1949,0718.38",The Buddha and his multiple emanations. (Object),,,"Fragment, showing multiple Buddha manifestations, from a larger composition. The haloed Buddha, seated in meditation with covered hands, wears the robe over both shoulders, its curved neckline in relief. The drapery folds are defined by paired grooves; below the hands the over-robe hangs in a semi-circle and onto the seat beside a spreading fall of gathered drapery from the left wrist, which appears less often when the hands are covered. The head is oval, with damaged undulating hair and a large damaged uṣṇīṣa, the eyes are shown as slits below lowered eyelids and the mouth is also almost a horizontal slit. Between each shoulder and thigh emerge and radiate three very damaged, haloed, standing Buddha figures with crudely indicated drapery folds and, in three instances, an 'abhayamudrā' hand (top left and two upper right). The second down on the left appears to wind an arm in his robe; the gesture on the others is not clear. The Buddha is sitting on the circular top of an obconical gynoecium rising from a lotus with three rows of petals, some sharply pointed, above a short stalk.
Beside the Buddha and on his own lotus base, which lacks a distinct gynoecium, a monk kneels with his back to him, his flexed lower left leg on his flat lotus top, the other leg vertical up to the knee; he looks upwards, no doubt at a major figure.

On complex preaching Buddha panels comparable subsidiary Buddhas, each with radiating emanations of himself, are at the top or some way towards it. This fragment, apparently on the left-hand side of a larger composition, may, from the position of the monk worshipping upwards, have been considerably lower down. The arrangement of radiating Buddhas is also found on panels where the preaching Buddha is the principal figure, and on these each subordinate Buddha stands on his own lotus base.Buddhas radiating from the subsidiary Buddhas of Lahore 1135 have been explained as emphasising their supernatural and magical character or, appropriately for Amitabha's paradise Sukhavati, as mandalas and 'meditative reflections of Amitabha' with emanations to teach the Dharma. The presence on Chandigarh 1137 of a Buddha and Bodhisattva, each with radiating emanations, has been seen, with the help of textual descriptions, as indicating rather the power of each to manifest appropriate forms for the spiritual betterment of humanity, an explanation also applicable to the independent images.

The identification os this bronze is controversial. We know that as Buddhist teaching developed, the idea that figures in the evolving pantheon could be differentiated by their sitting positions or their hand gestures gained ground. On the other hand, the most usual feature in the identification of Maitreya is a small stupa located in the headdress, which here is not apparent. 
The Buddha usually wears a monastic robe, as here, a feature which often clearly reveals the body beneath it. This is a stylistic feature which, in India, reached back at least to the Gupta period. The Kathmandu valley is renowned, nol only for its high quality of metal-workmanship, but also for the extent to which Indian styles continued long after they had fallen out of fashion in the lowlands. The Gupta inheritance of this image, although many centuries later, is still apparent.; Zwalf 1985
The early concept of successive ages each ruled by a different Buddha recognised a future Buddha called Maitreya. Originally represented as an ornamented figure with a pot, he can later be indistinguishable from a Buddha making the preaching gesture and seated in the so-called European posture as on a chair. The identification of the seated and preaching Maitreya in Buddha form is clear when he has a ‘stūpa’ in his head-dress or on a flanking lotus.

Statue of Buddha Amida
Amida, Buddha of Immeasurable Light, descends to greet the faithful and guide them to his Pure Land paradeise. He wears simple monk's robes and has tightly coiled hair and long earlobes. His calm, idealised features show that he is a fully enlightened Buddha, and his hands are positioned in a ritual gesture (mudra) of welcome.
The artist made the statue from hollowed-out pieces of wood, making it seem weightless. Sensitive carving of the robes and crystal eyes add realism.

The Buddha Amida stands with his hands in the gesture of welcoming the faithful followers of Jodo (Pure Land) Buddhism into the Western Paradise.; Zwalf 1985
The vitarka gesture identifies this Amitābha (Amida), the principal deity in temples of the True Pure Land or Jōdo Shinshū sect, as welcoming the souls of the dead (Japanese ‘raigō’) into Sukhāvatī, or the Pure Land.

The two schemes mentioned relate to the arrangement of the drapery folds on the over-robe or outer-garment of Gandharan standing Buddha figures. There are two types of folds: major and minor folds. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them there may be minor folds, usually thin ribs in very low relief. The alternation of major and minor folds may continue down the whole body (as in this figure) , or may be concentrated on the upper part of the body (see 1899.0715.1). There are also sculptures where the minor folds are almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11). The folds are usually arranged according to two basic rules: the folds above the middle are generally centred on the right side of the body, and those downwards from it are distributed along a vertical line between the legs.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

'Miss Weerasinghe's father, Mr George Weerasinghe came to this country from Ceylon in 1901 for the coronation of Edward VII, met his wife and took up residence here.  He had been part of a Buddhist Community, as a novitiate monk, in Ceylon and followed Buddhist principles and meditated every day.  I do not know the origens [sic] of the Buddha but having seen it first in 1938 I thought it was Sinhalese and that he had brought it to this country.  As an antiques dealer Mr. Weerasinghe made many imports ......'  earlier in the same letter she says, 'She [Miss Weerasinghe] always said that she would like to see it [the sculpture] in an appropriate setting and I have decided that the Oriental Department of the British Museum would fulfil this desire.'

The ears are close to the head and the ūrṇā a large incised circle.

Originally two worshippers knelt, hands joined, beside the lotus base. The surviving figure wears an uttarīya and has a hairstyle of wide and curled vertical bands. Flanking the Buddha himself stand two haloed Bodhisattvas with plump faces and long narrow eyes below heavy, sharply cut lids. Both wear the uttarīya in the wide mode, and the drapery folds are mainly in paired grooves. Both have collars and necklaces with a central ornament, earrings and bracelets; the figure on the Buddha's right wears a crested turban with retaining bands; the other, Maitreya, has a small double-looped chignon with a pointed ornament in front and a beaded diadem below.

At the top, between them, is a canopy of three flowers with acanthus-like petals and what must have been a beaded garland in their centres.

While adapted from Chinese Tang sculpture, this is a characteristic Silla-period bronze. The right hand is raised in the gesture of reassurance, while the position of the left can be explained as symbolising one of the Nine Classes of Life in the Pure Land, according to the specific merits of the devotee in relation to his rebirth in Paradise.; 2016 National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage catalogue entries:
'This gilt-bronze statue represents the Buddha standing on an octagonal lotus pedestal with a robe draped across both shoulders, making hand gestures (mudras) symbolizing fearlessness and wish fulfillment. The Buddha is characterized by a benignly plump face with clearly defined features, conch-shaped hair and a large topknot. The round shoulders, slender waist, and rather voluminous limbs gives the Buddha a robust figure.

The two schemes mentioned relate to the arrangement of the drapery folds on the over-robe or outer-garment of Gandharan standing Buddha figures. There are two types of folds: major and minor folds. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them there may be minor folds, usually thin ribs in very low relief. The alternation of major and minor folds may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1 8), or may be concentrated on the upper part of the body (see 1899.0715.1 2). There are also sculptures where the minor folds are almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11 12). The folds are usually arranged according to two basic rules: the folds above the middle are generally centred on the right side of the body, and those downwards from it are distributed along a vertical line between the legs.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, cracked, exfoliated and with soil incrustation.

This is a phrase in Thai language which we would romanize today as 'Phra Yuen', meaning a standing Buddha image.
In the north of Thailand, where this image may have originated, the standing posture may signify the Buddha 'calling for rain' to end a drought. It may also represent the Buddha 'opening up the three worlds:' it is said that the Buddha once visited his mother in heaven and preached to her and to the gods; when he returned to the earth, he descended from heaven via stairs made of gold, silver and jewels. He miraculously enabled heaven, the earth and hell to be revealed, such that the gods, humans, demons, hell-beings and other creatures in all of these places were able to see each other. The Buddha is said to have raised his arms upwards to show heaven, to have raised them midway to show the earth, and lowered them to show hell. Only the last of these seems to ever be illustrated, however. 
See Carol Stratton, Buddhist Sculpture of Northern Thailand (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Books, 2004), p. 45.; The collector of this object was Carl Bock, a Norwegian naturalist who visited Siam and areas to the north of it from June or July 1881 until August 1882. His account of his travels was published in London in 1884 as Temples and Elephants: The Narrative of a Journey of Exploration Through Upper Siam and Lao (Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, & Rivington).
Bock spent time in what is now central Thailand, including in Bangkok, the capital of Siam, and the towns of Paknam, Ayutthaya, Petchaburi, Ratchaburi, Kanchanaburi, Kamphaeng Phet and Tak (Raheng). He also travelled in today’s northern Thailand, visiting places along the Ping and Kok rivers including Lampang, Lamphun, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Chiang Saen and Fang.  
In Bock’s book, he used the term “Lao” to refer to northern Thailand.  This use of “Lao” differs from the contemporary understanding of “Lao.” In the late 19th century, Thailand, or Siam as it was then known, did not have the national borders which it has today. The so-called “Lao” area visited by Bock along the Ping and Kok rivers was the kingdom of Lanna, then a tributary of the kingdom of Siam. The Siamese in Bangkok referred to the land and people of Lanna as Lao even though the people of Lanna did not regard themselves as Lao. The dominant group in Lanna was the Tai Yuan. There were also various Shan, Karen and mountain peoples as well as Burmese and Chinese. The Siamese and Lanna languages were not mutually comprehensible. The Siamese government at Bangkok began to extend greater administrative control over Lanna beginning in about 1870, and Lanna was not fully absorbed into Siam until the turn of the century.
Although Bock’s publication as well as the British Museum records of the late 19th century refer to many of Bock’s items as Lao, they are unlikely to signify the Lao people and country as understood today. The items he describes as “Lao” are most likely to be from the Tai Yuan culture. Some also came from other groups living in the areas visited by Bock such as Shan, Karen and Lahu. 
Items from the Bock collection include those produced by these groups as well as by the Siamese (Thai).",,Not on display,,,buddha,Representation of: Buddha (Śākyamuni/Shijiamouni/Shaka),,,,Bequeathed by: Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks,,,,,,,Asia,,FBInd.38,Miscellaneous number: AF.5,,,,FBInd38

The term ‘backthrow’ refers to that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped.
The two schemes mentioned relate to the arrangement of the drapery folds on the over-robe or outer-garment of Gandharan standing Buddha figures. There are two types of folds: major and minor folds. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them there may be minor folds, usually thin ribs in very low relief. The alternation of major and minor folds may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1), or may be concentrated on the upper part of the body (see 1899.0715.1). There are also sculptures where the minor folds are almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11). The folds are usually arranged according to two basic rules: the folds above the middle are generally centred on the right side of the body, and those downwards from it are distributed along a vertical line between the legs.
Two recurrent features of the draped Buddha image relate to the fall of the drapery, which can be represented as cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it (see 1947.0511.1), or as an edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow, which goes along the left forearm and is held to secure the robes in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped from the first layer of cloth (the undergarment), usually appears looped (see 1899.0715.1).",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and exfoliated.

According to the inscription on the base, it was dedicated to the Chongguang Temple 崇光寺 in Hancui village 韓崔村 in AD585. Both the temple and the village can no longer be identified, but it is thought that the location was south-west of Baoding 保定 in Hebei province, a region known for its white marble sculptures. 
Buddhism was slowly introduced into China from first century AD and was widespread during the period of division from second to sixth century AD. After achieving the reunification of much of China by AD 581, the two emperors of the Sui dynasty (AD 581-618), both devout Buddhists, made Buddhism a state religion. Amitābha, literally meaning boundless light in Sanskrit, is the principal Buddha of the Pure Land sect 淨土宗 popular in China in the sixth to seventh centuries. 
Almost 8m high, this statue is comparable in size with figures carved in the rock at the Buddhist cave temples of central China from the 5th-7th centuries. During this period, Chinese Buddhist sculpture underwent a transition in style. The earliest stylised images gave way to a greater naturalism, characterised with anatomically credible bodies, probably influenced by the art of Gupta India.
The hands of the statue are missing but the right hand would have been 		raised, palm outwards in the gesture of fearlessness (abhaya mudrā),  and 		the left hand lowered in the gesture of wish-granting (varada mudrā).
A joint and a polished work surface at the waist show that the statue was carved in two separate parts. 
Traces of pigments on more than one location on the surface suggest that the statue was once covered with gilding and colours. 
Buddhist figures often sit or stand on a lotus. Lotuses, as symbols  of purity, enlightenment and divine birth, are an important image in  Buddhist art.
This statue was originally flanked by two smaller figures of bodhisattvas (enlightening beings), one of which is now in the Tokyo National Museum.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Rawson 1992 / The British Museum Book of Chinese Art; Pemberton 2002 / The Buddha; Michaelson & Portal 2006 / Chinese Art in Detail; Howard et al. 2006 / Chinese Sculpture,On display (North Stairs),"Exhibited:

Magnificently gilt and coloured, this wooden sculpture well illustrates the quality of some nineteenth-century Burmese sculpture. 
The record of its gift, along with another image from the same donor (a multi-headed figure swathed in a snake and riding on a bull who must be Shiva riding on his bull mount, Nandi), indicates that the sculptures came originally from the palace at Mandalay, the seat of the last two kings of independent Burma, Mindon (1853-78) and Thibaw (1878-85).
The gesture of the figure - the two hands clenched on the knees - marks him out as being non-Buddhist, and it seems likely that this is an Indian deity whose shrine was located in the palace as part of the inherited accoutrement of royal power that had descended in the Burmese polity, along with other ancient Indian elements such as 'brahmins' as court officials and the use of Indian law codes. Intriguingly, the number 15 in Burmese numerals can still be seen on the base of the lotus throne, suggesting the way in which sculptors worked in the palace workshops, carving from designs recorded in folding books, 'parabaik'. Indeed, Singer has convincingly linked this image and the other one in the same group with a 'parabaik' in the British Library whose title he translates as 'Illustrations of objects in daily use in the Golden Palace'. This 'parabaik' contains paintings of Indian deities who were enshrined in the Mandalay palace. Number 15 in this sequence, the last, is named either 'Si-tra-bali' or 'Man'. Man or Mara is illustrated three times in ""Temple's Thirty-Seven Nats"" where he is described as 'Man Nat, Mara, the Evil Principle'. Mara is the demon who, in the Life Story of the Buddha, summons warriors and seductive maidens to distract the Buddha during his meditation. This scene culminates in the Buddha calling on the Earth Goddess to witness that his merit accumulated in previous lives is sufficient for Enlightenment. The inclusion of the evil Mara among the images in the palace shrine was presumably to ensure that the evil principle was deflected through propitiation. Singer notes that, according to the Konbaungset Chronicle: 'Once a year at Thadingyut [October] ""fifteen days after the new moon"", the fifteen images were propitiated with great ceremony.' He goes on to say: 'In 1862, when Phayre and his entourage were visiting the Palace, they were allowed to witness the rituals performed by the court brahmins, mediums and guardians of the shrine'.",Isaacs & Blurton 2000 / Visions from the Golden Land.

The Bodhisattvas Fugen mounted on an elephant and Monju on a lion were brother princes born during the lifetime of the historical Buddha whom they usually flank in temple triads. The animals are among those present at the death of the Buddha. When the Buddha first appeared he either stood, or sat on a lion throne, and Monju is accordingly possessor of the power of the Buddhist Law expressed in the lion's roar. According to the 'Monju Shiri Hannehangyo sutra', Monju died in enlightenment 451 years after the Buddha. He is known as the Bodhisattva of wisdom, and is depicted here carrying his main attribute, the sword of knowledge. Inscribed on the back of each figure is 'The grand sculptor Koyu, the lay priest Sakkyo, by Imperial Decree given the title Hoin [Seal of the Law]'.

The two schemes mentioned relate to the arrangement of the drapery folds on the over-robe or outer-garment of Gandharan standing Buddha figures. There are two types of folds: major and minor folds. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them there may be minor folds, usually thin ribs in very low relief.

Two recurrent features of the draped Buddha image relate to the fall of the drapery, which can be represented as cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it (see 1947.0511.1), or as an edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow (that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped), which goes along the left forearm and is held to secure the robes in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped from the first layer of cloth (the undergarment), usually appears looped, as in this figure.
For this early type see Marshall, 1960: 61, referring to similar figures as 'the earliest of their kind', and plus 58-9, figs 85-6. For other similar types see Peshawar 2086 (Tissot, 1985a: fig. 149); Berlin MIK 1 44, 114, 527; Cleveland 72.43, dated (Czuma, 1985: no. 107) to the second half of the 2nd century.; Zwalf 1985
The angle of the right forearm and rough projection at the armpit where a strut supported the lost hand show that this Buddha was in the gesture of reassurance, offering protection to the worshipper. The left hand holds an end of cloth from the robe, and the lower undergarment can be seen above the lost feet. There is a noticeable moustache on the upper lip, and the broken halo has traces of an ancient repair. In type this Buddha is reminiscent of that on the Kaniṣka coin (no. 121).",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Koezuka (1994) / Masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu Art from the British Museum; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The two schemes mentioned relate to the arrangement of the drapery folds on the over-robe or outer-garment of Gandharan standing Buddha figures. There are two types of folds: major and minor folds. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them there may be minor folds, usually thin ribs in very low relief. The alternation of major and minor folds may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1), or may be concentrated on the upper part of the body (see 1899.0715.1). There are also sculptures where the minor folds are almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11). The folds are usually arranged according to two basic rules: the folds above the middle are generally centred on the right side of the body, and those downwards from it are distributed along a vertical line between the legs.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Light grey schist, broken.

The over-robe covers both shoulders with a wide neckline and prominent folds form a 'V' on the front, which barely indicate the backthrow. It has to be noted that the backthrow does not appear under the left forearm. The garment is worn close-fitting, almost in the fashion of wet drapery; the breasts, abdomen and legs, particularly the flexed right knee, are plainly indicated and the ridged and grooved indications of folds are accentuated between the legs and above the left hand which grasps a short and looped length of drapery, while gathered drapery hangs below. The usual two undergarments appear below the drapery fall of the 'abhaya-mudra' arm. The shoulders are broad and enhanced by the width of the neckline and the grooved neck, while the torso appears foreshortened, the waist thin, the legs mechanically rounded and the toes and feet summarily modelled. The hands are large, the right with curved fingers, a membrane between index and thumb and a circle ringed with dots on the palm. The head is round to oval and the face full. The snail-shell curls are formed of originally applied and incised small discs continued into the large uṣṇīṣa and forming a peak over the forehead. Incised brows form wide arches over long and protruding globular eyes under low lids; the nose is straight with a sharp ridge; and the shaped mouth, with a fuller lower lip, is set into the broad lower face above a full chin. The damaged ears are close to the head and probably had long lobes.

Although metal technology from tool-making to the abundant minting of a money economy was clearly well understood, Buddhist metal sculpture has proved elusive, with the examples known today being few, of modest size and mainly late. See also 1958.0714.1.
The face may be compared with others of the stucco tradition and Gupta-period Mathura Buddhas.
The term ‘backthrow’ refers to that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped. Two recurrent features of the draped Buddha image relate to the fall of the drapery, which can be represented as cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it (see 1947.0511.1), or as an edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow, which goes along the left forearm and is held to secure the robes in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped from the first layer of cloth (the undergarment), usually appears looped (see 1899.0715.1).; Zwalf 1985
This very different example from the few surviving Gandharan bronzes belongs to a group from a single findspot and perhaps atelier. The ridged drapery is very conventional, and the face recalls not only the later Gandharan stucco sculpture but, even farther afield, Gupta-period Buddhas from central India such as that from Mankuwar dated to AD 448-9 (or 429). The backplate, common to the whole group, has a radiating ornament which appears early in Gandhara, but its closest resemblance is with painting dated to the 7th century.","von Schroeder 1981 / Indo-Tibetan Bronzes; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Errington & Cribb 1992 / The Crossroads of Asia  [Cat. of an exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge]; Koezuka (1994) / Masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu Art from the British Museum; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum",On display (G33/dc51b/s3),"Exhibited:

The edge of the outer garment, worn to leave the right shoulder bare, is in higher relief across the chest where an undergarment is visible above it. Between the knees and lying flat on the seat are a semi-circular lower edge and thicker undulating fall of gathered drapery from the right forearm, where an edge of the backthrow is drawn close and a small loop hangs beside it. The drapery folds are a mixture of ridges and terraces with rounded edges. The head, inclined downwards, is oval to square, and the hair undulates densely into the large globular uṣṇīṣa, which is bound by a thin twisted cord with a small disc in the middle. The forehead is narrow above sharp curved edges for eyebrows and long narrow eyes with heavy lids slant downwards to the proper left. The flat nose under the rather high ūrṇā continues the sharp browlines. The mouth is shaped with a hint of a moustache indicated by a small convexity on both sides of the large oval philtrum or vertical groove on the upper lip; the chin is full and the concave ears have short lobes.
The Buddha sits leaning forward, and while there are slight swellings to indicate the breasts, the abdomen is very flat. Above the bare arm a slight contraction below the shoulder suggests, with the elbow, biceps, and below the elbow the arm curves and tapers. The hands have straight thumbs and fluid fingers with nails. The fingers of the lower hand all touch the bottom of the upper, whose fingers curve round the columnar projection on the chest which also produces the required webbed effect between the fingers. The very summary upturned feet appear under the drapery and partly uncovered on the Buddha's right.

The very damaged base may have had chamfered corners in the front and palmettes at the sides.
The two schemes mentioned relate to the arrangement of the drapery folds on the over-robe or outer-garment of Gandharan standing Buddha figures. There are two types of folds: major and minor folds. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them there may be minor folds, usually thin ribs in very low relief. The alternation of major and minor folds may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1), or may be concentrated on the upper part of the body (see 1899.0715.1). There are also sculptures where the minor folds are almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11). The folds are usually arranged according to two basic rules: the folds above the middle are generally centred on the right side of the body, and those downwards from it are distributed along a vertical line between the legs.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Broken, cracked, exfoliated and with soil incrustation.

The full, rather fleshy features prominent on several heads, especially 1880.112, 1880.110, 1880.111 and 1880.117, suggest Gupta influence and a late date.

He describes the Buddha figures as c. 15-20 cm in height, comprising 'a strong cast head fixed on a body of earth, whence the heads only can be brought away. They are seated and clothed in folds of drapery, and the hair is woven into rows of curls.

The animals are among those present at the death of the Buddha. When the Buddha first appeared he either stood, or sat on a lion throne, and Monju is accordingly possessor of the power of the Buddhist Law expressed in the lion's roar.

(Object),,,"Panel showing the Submission of Apalāla. The haloed Buddha, his body in three-quarter view but with the head almost in profile, stands in a crescentic curve, the overrobe covering both shoulders and the raised neckline evenly curving. He raises one hand with the palm partly inwards, while the other hand secures the robe at waist level. His eyes are open; the hair undulates into the small uṣṇīṣa and the halo has a narrow border. Behind the Buddha stands a Vajrapāṇi, a rounded vajra at his shoulder; he appears rather like a rustic or ascetic with a large nose and bulbous eyes, abundantly bearded, full-bellied and wearing a short paridhāna with a thick girdle (uttarīya).
In a small fenced tank in front of the Buddha three figures, each with a serpent rising from behind, join their hands. The first, male, has a five-headed serpent, and wears a crested turban with large globular ornament and an uttarīya; the second, a female, wears a sleeved tunic and another garment from her left shoulder, a necklace, earring, bracelet, a wreath headdress and flower in the hair beneath a single rearing serpent; the third, also female, similarly dressed and under a single serpent, turns to look in dread over her shoulder at another Vajrapāṇi. The rectangular tank is enclosed by a plain wall with a rocky terrain at its foot and mouldings with sawtooth enrichment beneath a vedikā of plain, worn uprights crossed by bars of curved section under a coping with sawtooth enrichment. Low down on the side facing the Buddha a spout in the form of a lion's head appears to emit water.
Beside and above the tank, small rounded bluffs with patches of vegetation conveyed by radiating lines indicate mountainous terrain (see BM 1902.1002.18) which appears to oversail the tank. Within it a muscular Vajrapāṇi, of less rustic and more threatening expression than the other, stands with one foot on a higher ledge, both arms stretched out, one holding a flattened faceted vajra.
The scene has on both sides a pilaster with, on the shaft, a long, narrow, recessed oblong panel curved at the top and bottom. It has a rectangular Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts and the usual base; its prominent plinth and torus seem parts of the complex lower frame. Above one pilaster a voluted double-bracket capital survives with sawtooth enrichment. On the right is a crenellated bastion with slanting returning walls, rectangular and pointed loopholes and a wall above receding according to a form of perspective. Beyond the left-hand pilaster two figures are separated by a tree; one may be a woman in a tunic and paridhāna without ornaments who is holding (receiving) a bowl in one or both hands; the other, facing, a male figure possibly with a crested turban, a paridhāna and a twisted scarf wound twice across the torso, seems to stretch out one hand under the bowl and with the other appears to hold the hilt of a sword. Behind is another tree.

Only sources in translation now give an account of a dragon of Swat named  Apalāla who, with his wife and children, ravaged the crops and was brought into submission by the Buddha, in some instances with the vigorous help of Vajrapāṇi. Originally situated in Magadha, this event became associated with the Buddha's legendary travels in the Northwest and acquired a local importance.
The appearance of the second and aggressive Vajrapāṇi assaulting the nāga and his family, to all appearances in continuous narration, is explained by Foucher (1905-51: I, 550-3) as an adaptation of the composition used for the subject of BM 1880.196. The placid Vajrapāṇi of the latter remains beside the Buddha and is supplemented by a more suitable for the task, usually above the nāgas in the mountainous landscape of Swat. Representations have the nāga(s) standing upright as in the following piece; half-length as above in a tank or water; half-length without any aquatic feature as in BM 1962.1114.1 and Berlin MIK I 182; kneeling below a rocky landscape with or without any aquatic feature; in a cave with the source of the Swat river; in a cave apparently without or on a rocky mound lapped by water.

The haloed and seated Buddha wears the over-robe leaving his right shoulder and feet bare and an undergarment visible below his right shoulder; it lies on the seat beside a fall of gathered drapery from his left wrist which spreads out. The drapery folds are defined mainly by paired grooves separating broad flat strips. The head is a long and regular oval; the hair, representing the Indian snail-shell curl tradition, consists of a series of beaded rows running from side to side and concentric on the uṣṇīṣa. The eyes are rounded and open with prominent lids under gently rounded brows, and there is no ūrṇā. The nose is broad, the mouth shaped, the chin prominent and the concave ears stand out symmetrically. The hands have long fluid fingers, the left index and middle fingers touching the bottom of the right hand in the preaching gesture. The Buddha's seat is the top of an obconical gynoecium tapering into a lotus with two downturned rows of plain petals, the lower row showing another beneath.
The Bodhisattva on the Buddha's left wears a patterned collar and a necklace with a plain strand and one of beads, and the uttarīya loops in the narrow mode. His left hand holds a damaged garland and his right may have been in 'abhayamudra'. The turban has a large crest and tapering central ornament, and retaining bands radiate from below it. The face is oval and long with long, narrow, low-lidded eyes and a long, straight, rather prominent mouth. The earrings have pendent beads. The other Bodhisattva, presumably Maitreya, wears a similar collar and necklace, a cord with a crescentic amulet and three or four boxes, one cylindrical, paridhāna and uttarīya with paired grooves for folds and worn in the wide mode; a water pot was probably held in his lost left hand. Most of his right forearm is lost; the hand may have been in 'abhayamudra' or turned palm inwards. He wears a diadem, earrings with beaded hoop and a horizontal length of hair, knotted over a chignon and looped on one side. His face, similar to that of the other Bodhisattva, is more gently rounded. Both Bodhisattvas lack the ūrṇā, are haloed and stand on feet with long toes on a lotus pedestal like the Buddha's; one lotus also has a short stalk. The three haloes overlap.
Below the Buddha an incense-burner or lamp (showing flames rather than smoke) on a columnar stand is flanked by a worshipper with knee-length tunic, ornamented trousers, moustache, two horizontal rows of curls over the forehead,
vertical bands of curls above and a chignon, kneeling with hands joined while a woman with a prominent band of hair in front and a loop of hair behind kneels opposite; she wears armlets, bracelets, earrings, collar, a tunic, a cloak gathered over her right leg and a scarf. Both have small, protruding, rounded eyes.
Above the haloes may be the remains of flying figures bearing a crown or garland.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Jamalgarhi,stone,,,carved,Diameter: 9.70 centimetres; Height: 40.60 centimetres; Width: 27.30 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
Relatively simple triads of a seated Buddha preaching and flanked by more or less frontal standing Bodhisattvas have been grouped with more complicated, densely inhabited and sometimes architecturally very ornate panels, often with the same Bodhisattvas less prominent, standing or seated, also flanking a preaching Buddha. The Bodhisattva with a water pot is generally accepted as Maitreya but the opposite, turbaned figure is still subject to discussion. Either Bodhisattva may stand on the Buddha's right and can also vary in iconographic detail: both may hold the right hand in 'abhayamudra', but Maitreya may turn the palm inwards, or hold a lotus instead, and the turbaned figure may hold a lotus or garland in his left hand. All too often the hands and attributes are lost. The Buddha usually sits on an open lotus which may, as here, have petals turned down or pointing upwards and sometimes a stalk below rising out of water. Many other details vary.
This group was interpreted, following Divyāvadāna XII, as representing the multiplication aspect of the Miracle of Śrāvastī, the kneeling persons as Lūhasudatta and his wife and the flanking figures as Indra and Brahmā. Subsequent interpretations have been as 'ordinary worshipping scenes' with Bodhisattvas, as a general theophany symbolising immanence and power, as a revelation of doctrine to assemblies as in the Mahāyāna sūtras and as paradisiacal relief scenes with Amitābha in certain instances as the central Buddha. In an unpublished study Filigenzi sees the triads as simplified versions, appropriate for more personal worship, of the more complex theophanies which she interprets as manifestations of the saṃbhogakāya or divine principle as Buddha revealed to Bodhisattvas; while the flanking Bodhisattva with water pot is Maitreya, she sees the turbaned Bodhisattva as Avalokiteśvara and proposes varieties of solar iconography to identify him in Gandhāra. In another unpublished study, which draws much on work in Japanese, Rhi argues in detail against many of the past interpretations but believes it possible, judging iconographically, that what he has called preaching Buddha panels were an early representation of Śākyamuni and the Bodhisattvas Siddhārtha and Maitreya combined without specific textual sanction and offered for reasons of economy on a single relief instead of by means of separate statuary disposed in chapels; complex and later instances, where Avalokiteśvara may have replaced Siddhārtha, in his opinion reflect Śākyamuni expounding in structures and assemblies and exhibit a ritual elaboration drawn from the holding of festivals and processions.; Zwalf 1985
This slab with its worshippers in foreign dress beside a fire altar may be an icon of developing Buddhism. The central Buddha, flanked by Bodhisattvas and preaching, can be seen as expounding fresh doctrine as in many Mahāyāna ‘sūtras’. The Bodhisattvas are, on the left, Maitreya, since his distinguishing flask is almost preserved and, on the right, perhaps Avalokiteśvara, though he lacks the Buddha figure in the head-dress occasionally seen in Gandharan sculptures also in this context. This is an early example of the triads of Buddhas flanked by Bodhisattvas that became common later.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Shimada and Willis 2016 / Amaravati: The Art of an Early Buddhist Monument in Context,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The head is oval and the wavy hair is drawn back in locks of varying relief, which curve in crescents to each side forming a pointed oval above the peak, and continue into the uṣṇīṣa which is secured at its base by a thin twisted band. The modelled face is fleshy. The ūrṇā lies in a depression of the forehead; the eyebrows, a distinct arched edge above the lightly convex slope to the eyes, continue more sharply onto the bridge of the nose; and the horizontal eyes have upper lids with sharp edges over rounded eyeballs. The mouth, with shaped lips, has a projecting upper lip suggesting a moustache. The chin is full and the concave ears, with a deep oval recess in the lobes, are set close to the head.
The breasts and abdomen are gently rounded. The right leg is flexed at the knee and the weight of the body is on the left leg. Where visible, the legs are columnar and without modelling, and the feet have long toes with nails and ridges for knuckles. The backplate, with a vertical reinforcing ridge between the legs, is rounded at the sides.
A short upper undergarment is visible under one of the arms and another longer undergarment hangs as far as the ankles. An effect of wet drapery on this Buddha, especially on the shoulders, is nearly lost under the dense folds.

The raised right arm and distinct backthrow (that part of the robe which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped) on the somewhat thick, plunging neckline result in the usual two schemes of drapery folds on the overrobe of the standing Buddha image. According to these schemes, curves above the middle are centred on the right side of the body and those downwards from it along a vertical line between the legs. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets, as here, and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them may be minor folds, usually a thin rib in very low relief; as on the present figure the alternation may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1 and 1961.0519.1); in other cases  it is concentrated in the upper body (see 1899.0715.1 or 1940.0713.8); and the minor folds may also be almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11). Two other recurrent features of the draped Buddha image are the more or less thick fall of drapery, representing cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it, here dense and ending in meandering edges, and the edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow drawn along and under the left forearm and held to secure the robes more thoroughly in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped before draping, usually appears looped (see 1950.1211.6).",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/od),,"1.

Errington: Masson records excavating a mound at the entrance to Khol Shams, south of Kabul, in 1833 (1842, vol.3, pp.93-6). He found an 'arched recess, ornamentally carved, and supported by two slender pillars. In it [were] the remains of several earthen images; the heads of the two larger ones only were sufficiently entire to bear removal. They were evidently of female figures, and of very regular and handsome features ... slight traces ascertain that the figures had been originally covered with layers of white and red paint, and that over the latter had been placed a surface of gold leaf. The hair of the heads, tastefully arranged in curls, had been painted with an azure colour. The recess also had been embellished with gold leaf and lapis lazuli tints'. The two heads, and fragments of a birch bark manuscript from the site (see 1880.3891.b) were dispatched from Kabul, together with 8 stucco Buddha heads from Hadda (see 1880.107, 109-119, 121) in December 1834 (MSS Eur. E 161/VII, f.22), finally arriving in London in mid 1837 (Errington 2006, pp.90, 92, n.28).
Although no documentation linking this head and 1880.122 to Masson or the India Museum appears to survive, the likelihood of their being the two from Khol Shams is reinforced by the following points. We know that the heads reached the India Museum with the rest of the 1834 shipment in 1837. 1880.106 and 1880.122 are the only two clay objects without provenance in the collection that fit the description of the missing heads: 1880.122 appears to be the head of a woman and, at the time of excavation, Masson did not realise the Buddhist nature of his finds and routinely describes Buddha heads as female. Painted clay figures of the 4th-5th century and later predominate at Hadda and sites around Kabul, Zwalf (above) notes the stylistic affinity between this head and 1880.110-112, 1880.117 acquired by Masson at Hadda. There are even stronger links with the painted clay statues from the neighbouring Kabul site of Tepe Marinjan (see F.

The major and some of the minor drapery folds are thick rounded ridges and terraces. The upturned feet are hidden under the drapery, except on the Buddha's right.

The over-robe covers both shoulders and has an almost circular neckline with prominent ridged folds. In the front, the robe has regularly spaced and ridged folds following two schemes: a lower scheme of curves concentric with the neckline, which seems to be governed by the raised right forearm; and another of almost vertical folds from the neckline where, in addition, there seens to be a ridge of drapery rounding the vertical folds to the Buddha's right. This appears to reverse the usual direction taken by the backthrow. Nevertheless over the drapery folds on the back, which curve concentrically with the neckline, a backthrow hangs in the usual way behind and under the left forearm, and a length of drapery runs, without being held by them, across the left palm and between the thumb and index finger. The robe is slightly parted below the left forearm but a long undergarment can be seen only below the right arm and above the ankles. The surviving hand is large and the fingers, with distinguishable nails, partly separate pointing upwards. The feet, below columnar legs showing no ankle bones, are large and indifferently executed, with the toes flatter on the right foot.

Although metal technology from tool-making to the abundant minting of a money economy was clearly well understood, Buddhist metal sculpture has proved elusive, with the examples known today being few, of modest size and mainly late. See also 1981.0610.1.
There is little modelling of the body. The abdomen and the back hindquarters can be distinguished under the fall of the robe, but the breasts are hardly indicated. The Buddha's stance is not wholly frontal: his right side has a forward movement, perhaps once enhanced by the lost hand as well as by the flexed leg. The face is most individual. Despite its youthful character, the long flat nose and the quite horizontal line of the eyes give it an unusual severity, examples of which can, however, also be found in later work in stone and in the stucco tradition. The face of an incomplete stucco figure, perhaps of a deity or bodhisattva (1887.0717.78), shows a great similarity, although executed in a much freer way and lacking the severity of gesture appreciated here.
The term ‘backthrow’ refers to that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped.
 
The precise metal composition of the figure can be found in ""Indo-Tibetan bronzes"" by von Schroeder, published in 1981 (p. 80).; Zwalf 1985
Presumably once making the gesture of reassurance, this rare example of a Gandharan bronze has a face of great individuality with its youthful open-eyed expression recalling the vivid later stucco sculptures. The ridged garment continues the Western realism in the Gandharan treatment of drapery but also contributes, with the large feet and hands, to a certain heaviness. If the dimensions were sufficient proof, this bronze might be one found by Cunningham at Mānikyāla.; Rawson 1992:
In Gandhara the Buddha was portrayed in his human form, not symbolically as had been the custom earlier in the Indian subcontinent. This image is a typical example and this model was adapted by the Chinese for their earliest images of the Buddha: the first Chinese bronze figures display the same U-shaped folds.
The very first Buddhist images in China had appeared only as incidental ornaments in tombs, mirrors and ceramics. In such contexts, they were equated with depictions of such spirits as the Queen Mother of the West. Under Chinese rule Buddhism was absorbed alongside other religious beliefs. Only under the rule of outsiders, from the fourth to the sixth century AD, such as the Liang in Gansu province and the Toba tribes (who took the title of Wei when they occupied North China), did Buddhism enjoy substantial imperial patronage. These foreign rulers encouraged the making of images in both stone and metal, including bronze, gold and silver.",von Schroeder 1981 / Indo-Tibetan Bronzes; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Rawson 1992 / The British Museum Book of Chinese Art; The Times 1959,On display (G33/dc51a/s1),"Exhibited:

Sitting figure, believed to be the Arhat Binzuru (Pindola)
This image is an excellent example of the technique known as 'yosegi zukuri', whereby separate pieces are carved and joined together to produce a hollow figure which is then covered in gesso or lacquer and painted.
When this figure was acquired by the British Museum it was thought to date from the Kamakura period (thirteenth century AD), although it was realised that it had been reconstructed to some extent. It was known, for example, that the front portion, including the knees and the hands holding the jewel, were recent additions. This is not unusual with Japanese wood sculpture of great age, and a considerable degree of restoration is accepted. Reconstruction both in antiquity and in recent times was invariably done with traditional tools using traditional materials, and sometimes using old wood acquired from the remains of other pieces of distressed sculpture or from buildings. It is therefore extremely difficult to judge whether or not wood sculpture is genuinely of ancient date. Modern fakers have made sculpture from old wood, smeared honey on the piece, and left it to be suitably ravaged by insects to give the appearance of age.
At first sight the eyes are naturally drawn to the serenely imposing face, and the rest of the figure seems quite in keeping with it. However, by looking not at the face, but at the shoulders, neck and back of the head, and then imagining how the face should sit, it becomes evident that the face does not match correctly. Conclusive evidence might be obtained by scientifically dating the various components of the statue, but the likelihood is that the mask which forms the face is an imaginative replacement of much later date, possibly twentieth century.
The Arhats are individuals who have achieved a level of spiritual understanding comparable with that of the Buddha. They occur in Japan in groups of 16, 18, or 5,000, and Binzuru is numbered first in the groups of 16.",Jones 1990a / Fake?

While in China some believers worship Budai as an incarnation of Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future, he is also numbered among the 'Luohan'. 'Luohan' (known in Sanskrit as 'arhats'; in Japanese as 'rakan') are enlightened disciples of Buddha whose role is to teach mankind the path to salvation and to protect the Buddhist faith. Budai is also known as the 'Calico-bag Monk'and his bag is supposed to contain precious things.
Nick Pearce suggested that three other figures, stylistically similar to the British Museum's Budai image and with similar inscriptions, might with the present piece belong to a larger traditional group of Eighteen 'Luohan'. All four are dated 1484, signed by the same master craftsman Liu Zhen, and were dedicated by the same priest, Dao Ji. All were sold through the London dealer John Sparks. These are a seated 'Luohan' in the Burrell Collection, Glasgow, a seated Guanyin in the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight, Liverpool, National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, and a Bodhidharma in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

An austere youthful ‘luohan' (arhat), this ceramic sculpture belongs to the celebrated set of sixteen or eighteen once placed in caves to the west of Yixian, Hebei province. The surviving ‘lohan’ from the set are so individually modelled that they have been considered portraits of eminent monks; however, a tradition of representating ‘lohan’ with very human faces certainly existed in China since the middle Tang, as evidenced by those surrounding Śākyamuni in no. 312. The Yixian figures are striking for their sombre dignity and power, and have nothing of the elevated caricature associated with Chan ‘lohan’ painting of the Five Dynasties and Song periods. The clay images in a ‘maṇḍala’ of the Three Worlds and Ten Directions within the 11th-century library at the Huayan si, Datong, include similarly imposing ‘lohan’.; Rawson 1992:
Made in the tradition of Tang dynasty portraiture of monks and priests, it represents the aspirations of the educated man to attain spiritual enlightenment.
Large glazed ceramic figures such as this one extended to Buddhism the tradition of moulding and modelling developed for pottery tomb figures. In the Ming and Qing periods imposing representations of many different Buddhist and Daoist deities were made, and their brilliant glazing resembles that of the tiles and figures decorating temple buildings.; Michaelson 2006:
'Luohan' were disciples of the Buddha who had magical powers and could stay alive indefinitely to preserve the Buddha's teachings. In China they were often shown in groups of sixteen or eighteen, with sets of 'luohan' figures placed along the side walls of a temple's entrance or in groups of pairs on either side of the main Buddha figure. 
The stern but serene face gives the impression of an individual while at the same time suggesting a commanding religious belief, thereby promoting the idea that all humanity might aspire to the spiritual understanding represented by the 'luohan'.
The figure is glazed in the 'sancai' (three-colour) lead palette characteristic of the Tang dynasty. Following the gently curving surface of the body, a network of vertical and horizontal bands denote the patchwork characteristic of a monk's mantle which was worn as a sign of humility. Monks generally owned only two possessions: their patchwork robe and a begging bowl.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Rawson 1992 / The British Museum Book of Chinese Art,On display (G33/od),"Exhibited:

From Whitfield 1985:
The great stupa at Rawak was one of the most important sites investigated by Stein on his first journey. Lying to the north of Khotan, high sand dunes helped to preserve it while subsoil water had destroyed the timbers that served to support its sculptures. The plan (see Ancient Khotan, Pl.XL) shows a vihāra court 161 feet (49.1 m)long by 141 feet (43.0m)wide, within which rose a stupa in three storeys, the lowest some 78 feet (23.8m)square. The stupa was approached by a staircase in the centre of each side; its summit, as measured by Stein, was some 23 1/2 feet (7.1m) above the floor of the court. The enclosing wall of this vihāra court was adorned, both inside and outside, with rows of colossal statues in clay stucco, supported on a wooden framework, which had completely disappeared. 
Because of the friable nature of the material, it was not possible for Stein to recover any of the larger figures intact: “All that could be done in the case of these large sculptures was to bury them again safely in the sand after they had been photographed and described” (Ancient Khotan, Vol.Ⅰ, p.502). The stupa and some of the very numerous statues lining the inner and outer walls of the stupa court are shown in Ancient Khotan (Figs.59-69), and other photographs from Emil Trinkler’s investigation of the site in 1927-28  are published by Gerd Gropp (1974, Figs.93-111 and Pls.XIII-XVIII). All of these show the magnificent scale of the whole sculptural arrangement, with larger than life-size standing figures of the Buddha alternating with smaller Buddha and Bodhisattva figures, some of them seated. The relatively small areas of wall in between the large relief figures were plastered and bore wall paintings of smaller figures, some of these probably being later additions (see Ancient Khotan, Vol.Ⅰ, p.492). 
The head shown here is from R. vi, one of the smaller Buddha figures on the inner south-west wall, standing between colossal Buddhas: the figure was broken by the fall of one of these(R. v, shown in Ancient Khotan, Fig.61) after it had been exposed for a day, but the head had been removed first and so survived. According to Stein, it was“in respect of pose, size and drapery a replica of the Buddha image R. ii. ”This figure, also visible in Fig.61 and, with its head in place, in Fig.69 of Ancient Khotan, was described by Stein in some detail (ibid., Vol. Ⅰ, pp.490-91). The form of the body is clearly visible, very narrow waisted and with swelling hips, beneath the drapery. As in the Gupta style, the drapery runs in raised lines over the smooth forms underneath, but here the lines are close-set and form stylised waves running down the figure from the neck-line. Behind the head, the nimbus was arranged in similar fashion to those reproduced by Gropp (1974, Figs.101, 103, 110) with a border of large overlapping spiral cloud scrolls, and a pointed flame extension at the top. Small seated appliqué figures of the Buddha, one at the top and two more on each side of the head, were set within the nimbus. The small appliqué seated Buddha in Pl.65 was intended for such a purpose, and is very similar, though it came from a different statue, R.lxxxiv. 
Although small in size compared with the largest figures, this head displays their principal characteristics. The whole face below the hairline is modelled in smooth curves, with very slight transitions between planes: in profile the eyebrows mark such a shift with little more than an incised line, and the small chin protrudes only slightly from the surrounding area. The eyes are sharply defined and are additionally modelled by a thick white application of stucco along the edges of the upper and lower lids. Little evidence remains of the original whitewash which probably covered the figure. Stein was able to describe a pink tīkā in the centre of the forehead, now difficult to distinguish. At the back of the head, a rectangular hollow almost the full width of the head marks the size of the supporting member of the timber framework behind the figure.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
熱瓦克塔是斯坦因第一次考古探險時發現的非常重要的遺跡之一。遺跡位於和闐北部，由於地下水的緣故支撐雕像群的木材已經腐蝕，然而厚厚的沙丘使它保存至今。據平面圖（參照《古代和闐》圖XL），寺址是49.1×43.0m的長方形，中央建有三層方塔，塔基邊長約23.8m。塔的各面中央設有臺階，據斯坦因測量，離地面約7.1m高。寺址四周圍牆的內外兩側都塑有聖像，莊嚴肅穆。最初支撐著的木架現在完全散落。
這些聖像質地脆弱易壞，斯坦因不可能完整地帶走較大的塑像。他說“我們拍照攝影和調查記錄工作結束後，只能把這些大塑像安全地埋回沙漠了”（《古代和闐》，卷1，502頁）。有關該塔和寺址圍牆內外側的塑像，除了《古代和闐》（圖59～69）外，Gerd Gropp出版的1927～1928年Emil Trinkler在此遺跡進行調查時所拍照片（《中國新疆•和闐考古發現》，1974，圖93～111及圖XIII-XVIII）中也有收錄。由此可瞭解造像規模之大，其中有比人高的立佛像，也有小一點的佛及菩薩塑像，有些是坐著的。在大佛像之間極狹窄的壁面上，塗上灰泥，繪有小的圖像，但其中有不少是後來加上的（見《古代和闐》，卷1，492頁）。
本圖所示的佛像頭部，是西南壁內側巨像間站立的一小佛像的頭部（R.vi）。此像因一身巨佛像的癱倒而毀壞（R.v，見《古代和闐》，圖61），由於風吹日曬，致使頭部與軀幹分離而殘存下來。依據斯坦因的說法，此像從“姿態、尺寸和衣紋等方面看，是R.vii佛像的複製品”。《古代和闐》的插圖61和69可以看到該像的全貌，斯坦因也作了詳細的記述（參照同書的490～491頁）。通過衣紋可清楚看到其體型為細腰肥臀Gupta風格的佛像。衣紋的線條隆起，柔順地覆蓋著身體，各個線條的間隔狹窄，形成波浪狀，從領口順著身體往下垂。頭部後面與Gropp（《中國新疆•和闐考古學發現》，1974，圖101，103，110）的形式一樣，旋渦狀的雲紋重合在大型帶狀紋的寶珠形項光上。在頭頂上和頭的兩側各貼一身小化佛。圖65的小佛就和這個小化佛一樣，儘管來自不同的塑像R.lxxxiv。
雖然尺寸與大的造像相比要少得多，但此像頭部也展示了其主要特徵。臉部前額的髮際刻板地往下拉，五官只有極小的起伏。即使從側面看，也只有一些微小的變化，眉毛只是稍有塌陷的刻線，下巴比其他部位稍微突起。眼睛很大，很清楚，上下眼瞼合在一起，貼著厚厚的白色睫毛。當初大概所有佛像都用白灰塗飾過，現在幾乎沒有痕跡了。在斯坦因記錄中，額中央還有粉色的白毫，但現在卻無法辨清。從頭像背後幾乎與頭尺寸相等的長方形凹槽可以想像原先支撐雕像木架之大。; Zwalf 1985
The great ‘stūpa’ at Rawak, north of Khotan, was surrounded by a large ‘vihāra’ court, 49.1 m by 43m. Considerable parts of the enclosing wall, adorned with images on both its faces, were preserved beneath the sand. These figures, many of them colossal, were of unfired clay supported on a timber framework, which had rotted away, so that some of the smaller heads alone could be removed. The present head is from one of the smaller Buddhas standing between colossal Buddhas on the inner south-east wall. The body of a similar figure visible in Stein's photographs is narrow-waisted, with thin drapery in narrow raised lines, as in Gupta sculptures.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith",Not on display,,,buddha; 佛 (Chinese),Representation of: Buddha;  Representation of: 佛陀,,,,,,,,1907,"The 1907-11-11 group refers to objects from Stein's First Central Asian  Expedition, 1900-01.

From Whitfield 1985:
The remains of the Miran vihara M. Ⅱ, as described by Stein (Serindia, Vol. I, p. 487), consisted of a solid mound of sun-dried bricks, in two storeys, with a base 46 by 36 feet (about 13.8 by 10.8 m) and a second storey, badly decayed, 17 by 15 2/1 feet (5.1 by 4.65m). A passage about 10 feet (3 m) wide enclosed the central portion of the shrine, and was lined along the outer wall with a row of colossal seated images of the Buddha, each measuring 7 feet to 7 feet 3 inches (about 2.1m) across the knees, and all in dhyana-mudra. Of these only the bases, hands and legs were preserved, but the head seen here had been protected through falling into the space, wider at the back than at the front, between two of these figures. It originally belonged to the third of five figures uncovered by Stein.
Although the head itself evidently cannot provide a firm basis for dating, evidence of various kinds noted by Stein leads to the date given here. The drapery over the knees of the figures was arranged as at Gandhara, with three concentric folds falling from the hands. The folds on two of the statues were in the form of boldly raised plaits about an inch (2.5cm) wide and on the other three, including this one, as narrow double grooves. There were traces of red colour, similar to the statues from Rawak. Further evidence came from the shape of the Indo-Persian stucco pilasters around the vihara base. These also show Gandharan features and must have taken time to develop into the forms seen later at Endere and Khadalik. Probably the most conclusive evidence for the dating of the Miran vihara is provided by the finding of a palm leaf pothi in Sanskrit, written in Brahmi characters of an early Gupta type, which cannot be later than the fifth century A.D., and by the corresponding absence of any relics of Tibetan writing (in contrast to Endere and Khadalik, where Tibetan documents were found in abundance).; Chinese

佛頭本身沒有任何提示確切年代的證據，但從斯坦因所記述的以下種種特徵，能夠推算它的年代。即蓋在佛像膝蓋上的衣紋線，是從兩手垂下的三條衣褶的集合點，此是犍陀羅式的。佛像其中的兩身上約有2.5釐米寬的粗褶子，包括本像在內的三身像上，有兩條狹窄的溝狀褶子，殘留著與熱瓦克出土的塑像群相似的紅色痕迹等。另外，更明確的證據是，還可舉出圍繞寺院部位的印度、波斯風格的灰泥壁柱形狀。它們具備犍陀羅的特徵，後又向安得悅和喀達里克見到的形式發展的。對米蘭寺院遺迹的年代判斷上，最具決定性的證據是，梵文貝葉的發現。那是用笈多王朝早期的婆羅謎文寫的，不可能晚於5世紀以後。另外，從完全沒有發現吐蕃文資料這一點上也應得到證實（與安得悅和喀達里克發現大量吐蕃文書形成對比）。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

The sculptural programme of Chola-period temples often includes this popular image of Shiva, within a niche, on the exterior wall of the shrine. Another favourite image of Shiva for an outside position is the god as 'dakshinamurti' (see BM 1961.0410.1). Although the South Indian images of this scene of Shaiva supremacy are the most well-known, a 10th-century fragment preserved in Benares shows the 'linga' of light surrounded by flames and with the figures of the astonished gods on either side of it. Unlike the Chola version, the god does not actually appear within the shaft of the 'linga'. It is tempting to connect the imagery of a fiery pillar with an earlier, but Buddhist, image which refers to the appearance of the Buddha as a pillar surrounded by flames.

Statue of Fudo Myo-o
This statue is the Buddhist deity Fudo Myo-o, 'Immovable King of Lighe'.
His fierce appearance shows his intolerance of wickedness. His rope binds the enemies of enlighenment and his sword cuts through the illusory world to reveal ultimate raalitey.
The painted sculpture was from a singl piece of wood, with arms added.
Fudo's body was originally blue, and carved flames were added later. Fudo Myo-o is an important deity in Tantric Buddhism.
His name , 'immovable',reflects the unchanging nature of ultimate reality beneath the illusion of his warlike appearance.
Wood, pigment, 1100s
(Label copy, 2017); Fudo Myo-O
Wood, Heian period, 12th century

Fudo Myo-O is depicted sometimes alone, sometimes as the foremost of the 'five Kings of Light' of the esoteric Shingon Buddhist sect, and sometimes with his two acolytes Kongara Doji and Shitaka Doji. The attributes of the deity are minutely described in a sutra of AD709. His fierce aspect shows his intolerance of wickedness, which he seeks out to chastise. The rope binds the illusory enemies of enlightenment, and the sword cuts through the illusory world revealing the ""Kongotai"", or ultimately real world. The sword hilt is in the form of a three barbed ""vajra"" symbolising the Buddha, the Lotus, and the ""Kongotai"" itself. Fudo's name, 'unmoving', indicates the unchanging nature of ultimate reality beneath the illusion of his warlike exterior. He is a patron deity for swordsmen.; Smith et al 1990
Fudo Myo-O is depicted sometimes alone, sometimes as the foremost of the five 'Kings of Light' of the esoteric Shingon sect, and sometimes with his two acolytes Kongara Doji and Shitaka Doji. The attributes of the deity are minutely described in a Shingon 'sutra' (AD 709). His fierce aspect shows his intolerance of wickedness, which he seeks out to chastise. The earliest Japanese representations have both eyes wide open and two fangs showing. Later works have one eye half shut, and one fang is sometimes shown on each jaw either side of the mouth. The sword also serves to cut through the evils of the illusory world revealing the 'kongotai', or ultimately real world, and the rope binds the illusory enemies of enlightenment. The hilt of the sword is in the form of a 'sankosho', or three-pronged 'vajra', which is one of the ritual implements of esoteric Buddhism symbolising the Buddha, the Lotus and the kongotai itself. Fudo's name means 'Unmoving', indicating the unchanging nature of ultimate reality beneath the illusion of his warlike exterior. Considered a patron deity for swordsmen, he strove to achieve enlightenment beyond the illusion of life and death.
The piece is carved in 'ichiboku zukuri' style, the arms made separately.; Zwalf 1985
Chief among the Vidyārājas (Myo-Ō), or personified spells and protectors of the Shingon sect, is Acala (Fudō or the Immoveable), whose attributes are a sword and rope. He symbolises spiritual steadfastness, and his fierceness his power to protect.

Behind it a grooved projection suggests drapery folds and round the neck is a groove. The turban is centrally crested and resembles that on BM 1880.191.The hair below it forms a short edge of tight spiral curls and, on the right, is disposed vertically.

On the sides of the turban but complete only on the right is a four-legged monster with a long, leaflike beard and wing; his long thin body curves upwards as on BM 1902.0520.4 and BM 1880.191 but is not held by a retaining band. Judging by the sides, which are carved as far as the roughly flat back, the head was turned to its left, but that side of the face, though flatter, is fully carved without notable asymmetry. A lack of finish, however, appears from details such as the plain upper retaining band and border around the crest, the more summarily carved and incomplete monster and less prominent curls below; the absence of the vertical loop of cloth with its prominent pleated end hanging below it as on the right side must be due to the angle of the head.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 9 centimetres; Height: 14 centimetres; Width: 10.40 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:

The headdress consists of long curled hair descending onto the shoulders from under a turban with two narrow, perhaps twisted, retaining bands radiating from now indistinct ornamental jaws gaping outwards on each side of a large barrel-shaped central bead. Beside it only one of originally two flanking rosettes survives, and between the bands a motif of squares bisected into triangles each containing a small indented triangle and separated vertically by stones.

Shrine xv of the Ming-oi shrines was “a plain cella about 12 feet square” and, like the other shrines, had suffered damage by fire; but in it Stein discovered both some fine pieces of wood carving (Pls. 114-15) and, among other examples of stucco reliefs, this large and beautiful Bodhisattva head. Like the small heads from Shrine xi, it has lost all trace of the original colouring in the fire that hardened it, but this has in no way impaired the fine modelling of the features and the cascading locks of hair. Seen next to the much smaller standing figures of devatas and similar pieces from the other shrines, the very scale of this head gives an idea of the size and richness of the whole ensemble, which must have included life-size or larger Buddha and Bodhisattva figures, as well as closely packed smaller figures.
In style and expression the head is close to the classical sculpture of Gandhara; in particular the half-closed eyes, like those of the Foucher Bodhisattva in the Musee Guimet, suggest meditation, and all of the other features are calm and regular.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
明屋遺迹之xv寺址是“邊長4米的簡單正方形内殿”，和其他佛寺一樣，遭受過火災的損壞，然而斯坦因從這裏發現過幾件較好的木雕作品（圖114、115）和泥浮雕，這個大而精美的菩薩頭部與xi寺址發現的小頭像相同，由於火災變得堅硬，而且完全失去了當初的色彩，但像的裝飾和波浪形下垂的頭髮等沒有受損。從其他寺址中得到的天部像等小型立像，可大致想象出此頭部的像的大小和整體形態，那無疑是與真人等身或更大的佛、菩薩像，以及還有衆多小像。
此菩薩頭部的風格和形態與犍陀羅雕刻風格接近，特別是半睜的眼睛，與集美美術館收藏的Foucher出土的菩薩像非常相似，樣子像是在冥想，表情極安祥。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
This pair of devatas are among the most complete of the hundreds of figures found by Stein in the cella of a ruined temple at Ming-oi, not far from the one containing the wall paintings of the preceding plate. Stein dated them and most of the other stuccos from the site to the eighth century, on the basis of coins placed near the images, which were dated to the Dali (A.D. 766-79) and Jianzhong (A.D. 780-83) reigns (Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1194). In the museum’s own display, they were dated even later, as eighth-to tenth-century pieces. Had it not been for the presence of these coins, Stein would have dated the images considerably earlier, but he felt that the numismatic evidence was conclusive and that the earlier style of the figures could be sufficiently accounted for by the discovery of moulds, which could have continued in use for centuries.
    As we have just seen in Pl. 95, there is no doubt that the Ming-oi site, with its extensive group of temples, was still in use in the Uighur period, since the costumes of the donors from the wall paintings are unmistakable. But the use of wall paintings as the principal decoration in this temple suggests that there had been a shift away from moulded stucco decorations, as the two media are not easily combined. Besides, coins could have been deposited by worshippers for as long as the temple remained accessible, and while the roofs of the shrines remained intact. Even after the collapse of the roofs, many unfired figures survived with their colouring until the present time. These considerations may allow us to establish the date of the figures according to their style, which is still close to the art of Gandhara. A later style. Showing Chinese influence, can also be identified in the stucco figures of some of the shrines, such as the Bodhisattva head of Pl. 102.
    In composition too, to judge by the sheer numbers of figures and the way that they were closely packed together (some groups still in situ are illustrated in photographs taken by Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. Ⅲ-Ⅴ), the relief decoration of the Ming-oi temples must have been comparable to that of Gandhara. Plate 96 shows some of these features in a single devata. Moulding was used extensively to give such figures their perfection of expression, with smooth and regular features, and for the appliqué scarves and ornaments. The devata is broken off at the knees, but Fig. 140 allows us to see the proportions of the long and slender legs of a similar piece. All are built up of layers of clay applied to a core of reeds bound in a bundle, over which the moulded form fitted as a final layer. Fire has destroyed the reed core, leaving only the impression of this and its binding, and has totally removed the original colouring, but at the same time it has hardened the clay and ensured its survival. The scarf around the shoulders frames the figure and masks the join to the wall, as with the next figure. Changes in attitude were probably made by adjusting the still-moist impression as taken from the mould, as was certainly done with many of the small heads shown in Pls. 104-9.
    Some actual moulds for small parts of figures are in the Stein Collection. One, Mi. iv. 001 (Fig. 148), is for casting a small single seated figure of the Buddha, two curls of hair, and two zig-zag locks (Serindia, Vol. Ⅳ, Pl. CXXXVII). Far more spectacular are the moulds made for the whole upper body and head of comparatively large figures, which are among the finds made by Oldenburg at Kucha and are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. More than thirty moulds were found at Ming-oi by Grunwedel and Le Coq (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 192). These moulds, like the one just referred to in the Stein Collection, are of plaster of Paris.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
斯坦因於明屋遺址發現上圖壁畫的寺的附近的一個寺址中的室裏發現數百塑像，這兩身天部像是其中破損最輕的兩件。斯坦因把同一遺迹的大致相同的這些泥像都斷爲8世紀。那是因爲離像不遠的地方發現了大曆（766～779年）和建中（780～783年）的貨幣（參照《西域》卷3，1194頁）。而在大英博物館的展品說明中，把它們的年代往後推至8～10世紀。如果沒有貨幣，斯坦因大概還會認爲這些像的年代更早，貨幣成了決定性的作用。有關這些像延襲了早期表現風格這點，數百年延續使用下來的模型的發現，可作充分說明。
正如圖95所示，明屋遺址以及許多寺院群無疑在回鶻時期仍然使用，根據壁畫上供養人的衣裳就能一目了然。但壁畫作爲該佛寺的主要裝飾而存在，顯示了由泥塑造像向壁畫图樣的轉變。因爲把兩者融洽地組合，是件不容易的事情。另外，貨幣遺物可能是塑造泥像沒遭破壞寺院仍然運轉時信徒們捐獻的香資。特別是屋脊沒有損壞而完整保留下來的寺中，即使倒塌了但沒有失火，塑像直到現在還完全保留著色彩。綜合以上考慮，這些像的年代，以風格極接近犍陀羅美術作爲最主要根據來判斷更合適。時代越往後，越能見到中國的影響，如圖102的菩薩頭部等及若干寺院的泥像。
結構上，其實由衆多像構成以及它們的組成方式（奧登堡在遺迹現場拍攝的若干圖的照片已收錄於他1914年的報告裏）等方面，這些明屋遺迹的身雕裝飾可與犍陀羅身雕裝飾進行比較。圖96中展示了具備那幾處特點的天部像。連細部都廣泛使用模子，産生出光滑有規則的表現。再者，天衣和裝飾物等粘貼的裝飾也用模子。此像膝蓋以下已缺損，但從Fig. 140我們可以推測出此像的比例。
這些像是在捆緊的槁草芯上反復塗上塑土，其上再安裝用模子製作的外形造型。經過火災，槁草的芯燃盡，只剩形狀和捆綁的繩子痕迹，色彩也比當初有變化，但經過燃燒塑土變得很堅硬，耐保存。披在兩肩上的天衣，像畫框一樣圍著塑像，遮蓋了鄰像和牆壁間的接合部。姿勢和表情的變化，可能是從模子裏取出以後，在半乾狀態下調整的，從圖104～109中展示的若干小像頭部可以窺出其究竟。
斯坦因的收集品中，包括很多實際製作這些像細部使用的模子，有一個小佛坐像的模子（Mi.iv.001）、兩個卷髮的模子、兩個穗狀頭髮的模子（參照《西域》，卷4，圖版CXXXVII）等。另外，奧登堡在庫車收集到的遺物中，有製作大型像上半身和頭部使用的大模子，現陳列于艾爾米塔什美術館。格倫威德爾和勒柯克在明屋發現的模子也有30多個（參照“Grunwedel”， 1912，192頁）。在巴黎的石膏模子與現在所談的斯坦因收集品中的模子相同。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

The Bodhisattva raises his hand in abhaya at 45 degrees and forward from the body; he holds a water pot and wears only a collar, bracelets and earrings as ornaments, uttarīya and paridhāna, and his chignon is secured by a band. Though full, his long face is also angular with open, almost staring eyes. The throne has turned legs and drapery, broken pillars supporting a flat canopy with a series of small festoons and tufts projecting at the sides. The curved and projecting borders have two registers of sawtooth enrichment and, on each side, a volute formed by a beaked head and neck. A framed register of stellate petals spans the top.
In the top compartment, now incomplete, a now headless Buddha turns to his right towards two standing figures with uttarīya and no ornaments; one joins his hands, the nearer perhaps once extended a hand towards the Buddha. On his left are a kneeling figure, the raised knee towards the Buddha, and another, half-length in an uttarīya, both damaged.
In the tympanum is a sea-monster (panther) with a curled tail, once presumably worshipping a figure or cult object at the top with one or more corresponding figures beyond it (compare BM 1902.1002.23). The border on the surviving side has a sawtooth enrichment and a voluted beaked head above a pendent bunch of grapes.

In the central scene Siddhārtha half-reclines on a couch, wearing a high crested turban, an uttarīya in the narrow mode, earrings, a collar and a necklace over his right shoulder. He holds an indeterminate object (lotus) to his head in one hand and a wreath in the other. Seated beside him, his wife, her feet on a footstool, wears a wreath headdress with a loop of hair, earrings, collar and necklace, bracelets, anklets and a tunic with an overgarment draped over her left shoulder. She holds a bunch of lotuses at shoulder level. Their couch has a mattress, pillow, turned legs and a pendent cloth in between gathered at the side(s); above them (compare BM1900.0522.1) may be a damaged wreath. A flanking dancing girl in sleeved tunic and paridhāna worn tight round the legs raises her right leg and arm, and opposite a similar seated female, her right arm raised and undercut, is about to strike an upright banded barrel drum while her left hand strikes another on its side. In the balconies above very worn half-length female figures face each other, two holding flowers at shoulder level.
The couple are under a trapezoidal roof supported on slender Corinthian columns with the usual base mouldings; at the sides are similar half-columns, and all the columns have bracket capitals with sawtooth enrichment but only one bracket arm; the sawtooth motif is repeated beneath the balconies and on the fascia of the roof. One balcony has a floral diaper, the other has an open-work triangle motif. At the bottom is a torus with a twisted garland enrichment of beaded and plain bands, above is a sawtooth cornice and on either side a vertical open-work chequerboard register.
Each side compartment contains a standing figure with crested turban, collar, uttarīya, variously worn, and paridhāna, turned towards the central scene with flowers in both hands, while another ornamented figure, damaged on one side, with chignon and draped in an uttarīya, kneels inwards with hands joined.

The tradition of the Bodhisattva's luxurious life and palaces is a feature of canonical and other texts and descriptions may be found in connection with the marriage or among events, such as the Four Encounters, leading up to the Renunciation. The Saṃghabhedavastu tells of a night of women's music-making and of the conception of Rāhula followed immediately by the Bodhisattva's revulsion among the women.
Representations of palace life can agree with the composition of the Renunciation scenes as here and may imply an intentional contrast as well as closeness in time: thus the Bodhisattva lies on a bed with his wife seated on it while female musicians sit and lie around them; or the Bodhisattva and his wife are seated on the couch side by side. A different tradition may be present in a Bodhisattva shown impervious to distraction. A notable feature of palace scenes is their occurrence, as presumably here, on uprights or false gable panels where they can be followed in a downward vertical sequence by a Great Renunciation and then a Great Departure.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, cracked and exfoliated.

Rarely depicted in sculpture, Tejaprabha was usually painted and enshrined in a Hall of the Seven Stars (七星閣). Tejaprabha Buddha was linked to childbirth, wealth, talent and longevity, similar to Bhaisajyaguru Buddha. In Korean paintings, Tejaprabha is generally paired with the Sunlight and Moonlight Bodhisattvas (日光・月光普薩), attended by the Seven Stars incarnate.

The entry of the historical Buddha at the point of his death into 'nirvana' (Japanese 'nehan'), the blessed state of the extinction of personality in the ultimate reality of existence, is of the greatest importance in Buddhist theology, offering as it does a vision of the highest good. Images in sculpture of this event exist in India from as early as the second/third century AD; by the late Tang dynasty it had become a well-established subject for Chinese painting, and such a crucial image must have passed quickly to Japan, where the earliest-surviving example is eleventh century. 'Nehanzu', as they were known, would have been needed by every temple to exhibit on the celebration of the Buddha's death on the fifteenth day of the second month, and this accounts for the relatively large number which survive, however fragmentary, from the medieval period. As here, they often took the form of an unusually large hanging scroll suitable to be hung briefly in a large hall for general contemplation.
The image of the Buddha already transformed in death into a superhuman-sized deity is standard, as are the weeping disciples around his bier. Representatives of the animal world and of heavenly beings could be added according to the artist's imagination, and this crowd tended to increase continually up to the seventeenth century. The spirit of his mother Maya can be seen at top right, a favourite Japanese addition.; Zwalf 1985
On the fifteenth day of the second month paintings of the Buddha's death are hung in temples at commemorative ceremonies. The Buddha is traditionally depicted among trees surrounded by mourners. Peculiarly Japanese is the arrival of his mother Māyā with attendants at the top. This considerably restored painting displays 13th-century compositional characteristics and stylistic affinities with Song China. The gold leaf on the Buddha's robes and the gold dust on the Bodhisattvas' faces supported by the white pigment behind the silk are also 13th-century features.; Hizo Nihon bijutsu taikan Vol 1
Paintings depicting the Buddha entering nirvana have long served as the main image at various temples on the anniversary of the Buddha's death. This anniversary, the 'Nehan-e', is celebrated on February 15 and typically involves listening to a recitation of the 'Nehan-kyo', or Nirvana sutra. The faithful present at this ceremony reflect on their indebtedness and are believed to conceive Buddhas within themselves, which ensures that they, in turn, will enter nirvana as well.
Paintings of the Buddha entering nirvana may be divided broadly into two categories, both based on Chinese models. The first is believed to have derived from paintings of the Tang dynasty. This type is nearly square or, alternatively, rectangular and oriented horizontally. The composition is built around a point at the Buddha's feet as he lies on a jeweled pedestal, his arms and legs stretched out to either side. The Buddha and the relatively few personages, birds, and animals that surround him are all drawn on a large scale in this type of work.
By contrast, the second type is influenced by Sung-dynasty painting and is composed vertically. The composition centers around a point near the Buddha's head. The Buddha lies on a jeweled dais, his head resting on his right arm and his body slightly bent. He is surrounded by a great number of personages, along with birds and animals. At the top of the painting, descending on a cloud, is a group of figures headed by Anaritsusonja, one of the Buddha's most important disciples; also present is Maya, the Buddha's mother. A moon floats in the sky; the waves of the river Batsudaiga (J. Baidaga), located near the 'bodhi' tree where the Buddha passed away, may be seen flowing down between the 'sala' trees. The teachings expounded in the Nirvana sutra are presented quite faithfully in this type of painting.
The work under discussion here is of the second type, which became popular from the Kamakura period onward. The application of color, primarily in tones of navy blue, bluish green, vermilion, and red, the precision of the details, and the control of the brushwork all speak of the artist's technical mastery.
This work bears some resemblance to the paintings of Ryozen, active from the late Kamakura period through the Nanbokucho period; one of his nirvana paintings belongs to Fukui Honkaku-ji Temple. On closer comparison, however, it becomes evident that the brushwork in the present work is quite mild compared to Ryozen's bold, assertive ink lines.
In any case, the work is a fine example of the many Buddha Nirvana paintings that were produced in the late Kamakura period.; '1. Japanese. That this is not Chinese but Japanese is proved by certain details, e.g. the mode of wearing the hair in the figures of the youths at the right of the Buddha, the red outline to some of the faces, and other characteristics, - together with the actual style of the drawing.'

From Whitfield 1982:
The subject of this painting is an unusual one at Dunhuang, being found among the wall paintings only in Cave 72. Only the right arm of the central standing Buddha is now visible, outlined in ink and shaded in orange to give the impression of a golden colour. The arm is extended straight downwards with open palm and thumb and fingers closely pressed together. It is immediately recognizable as the gesture found in the Sakyamuni of the great embroidery shown in Vol. 3, Pl. 1, indicating that the subject is the sermon on the Vulture Peak, that is, the preaching of the Lotus Sutra. This is indeed confirmed by the rocky background and, among other birds in flight, an actual vulture perching on the top of the mountain above the canopy (Fig.66).
As the painting survives, only a little less than a quarter is preserved. This can be surmised from the construction alone, since a join in the silk runs down immediately behind the head of the monk, perhaps Sariputra as Waley suggested, who stands beside the Buddha. Following the usual make-up of a central whole width of silk with two half-widths, one either side, this means that the whole painting was originally very impressive, with the central figure of a standing Buddha, his body resplendent in its orange shading against the ornate mandorla and flame surround, set off by the dark rocks of the Vulture Peak, attended by a disciple on either side, and with narrative side scenes to the left and right. Something of its magnificence can still be seen from the sumptuous decoration of the petals of the lotus on which the monk stand: blue and orange seem to have been the dominant colours of the painting.
While the identification of the central Buddha allows us to refer to the embroidery (and the tiny embroidery, Vol.3, Pl.2) as well as to the image of Sakyamuni Preaching on the Vulture Peak found on a painting in New Delhi, other parts of which (Stein painting 51,Vol.2Pl.11) are in the British Museum, it is the narrative scenes at the side which link it to the wall paintings at Qianfodong. As suggested above, these narrative scenes cannot have been confined to the left side but must have been present on the right also. Of great interest is the fact that the standing image of the Buddha grasping his robe and with the right hand extended straight down is twice repeated in these scenes, to the lower left as a sculpture surrounded by a scaffold, with two men reaching out to the head, and near the top left outside a city wall as a free-standing image, towards which a monk stretches his left hand.
The explanation of these side scenes is made clear by the wall painting on the upper part of the south wall of Cave 72, which bears a series of inscribed cartouches that tell the story. Here the image of the Buddha, large and small, is shown many times in a landscape setting. In the centre of the wall Sakyamuni is shown with a large assembly; it is the scene to the right of this that chiefly concerns us here. The first image appears (Lo Archive, no. 072-7) at the top left of this part of the wall, with the caption: “The appearance of the iron(?) image from India” 鐵像從度印來現時. In the next scene to the right, the image is seen much larger, accompanied by apsarasas and disciples, but with the head missing. The inscription reads: “When the head was lost from the image of the Divine Countenance” 聖容像＃下去頭時. In the centre of the whole composition the image is shown again, this time with a scaffold erected around it, one figure climbing a ladder, two men  half-way up the scaffold and four more at the top supporting the head of the image, which is still slightly tilted. The caption reads:“When they managed to get the original head of the image of the Divine Countenance and replace it as it was before” 却得聖容像本頭安置仍著時.
Further repetitions of the image, with narrative of other events, occur in the top right section of the wall painting, but the three scenes already described are those that are give some prominence, just as the scene of the replacement of the head by two men on a scaffold is clearly the principal event shown in the surviving part of the silk painting. Nevertheless, some other parallels may be attempted; for instance, just in front of the scaffold in the silk painting is a pavilion with a blue roof (Pl.22-2). A pavilion also appears in Cave 72, and next to it the inscription reads: “When the Lohan saw the Divine Countenance and recorded it on a tablet”羅漢見聖容碑記時. Unfortunately, available photographs from the cave (the entire lower half of the wall has in any case faded leaving only a single image visible) are not clear enough to identify the other scenes in the silk painting. These, besides the two wind or thunder spirits with their rings of drums, supported on clouds (Pl.22-2, Fig.67), include a rider apparently reviewing a troop of soldiers in armour (Fig. 65) and, higher up, a monk on a mule, followed by an elephant carrying a large number of scriptures (Fig.64). The whole painting is thus concerned not only with the central image of the Buddha in the act of preaching the most important Mahayana scripture, the Saddharma-pundarida, or Lotus Sutra, but with the transmission of both images and scriptures from India eastwards.
Since writing the above, the good fortune of a visit from M.Robert Jera Bezard has led to the identification of another substantial (H.72.0 cm, W. 28.0 cm) and important part of the same painting. On seeing Stein 20 he immediately recalled a fragment in the Pelliot collection with the same basic colouring (Bannieres, No.25). The piece in question (Fig.63) shows a Bodhisattva kneeling before an incense burner, described in the catalogue entry as being that which stood directly beneath the main image. Indeed a fragment of two multi-coloured petals of the lotus pedestal is just visible. There are numerous much smaller figures :a group of musicians, two groups of horsemen with pennants, five monks and another figure of some authority near them. These and the landscape setting already recall the Stein painting, but the most fascinating detail is immediately in front of the kneeling Bodhisattva, the head only of a Buddha, described as green in colouring (the statues in the London painting appear metallic in hue although no colour is actually left), seen on a rectangular plinth between two trees. There can be no doubt that the same story is represented, and I personally have no hesitation at all in believing this to be a part of the same painting, the figure of the Bodhisattva being almost directly below that of the large standing monk in the Stein painting (Fig.62). By this we can deduce that the whole painting was over 170 cm high and about 120 cm wide. There would have been space for many more scenes from the whole narrative as shown in Cave 72.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1982:
該畫的主題在敦煌非常罕見，石窟壁畫中也僅在72窟中發現一例。主尊的立像只殘留右臂，墨描輪廓，橙色暈染，顯示出金色光輝。手臂筆直下垂，手掌展開，手指緊並。看一眼就會立刻想起第3卷圖1的刺繡作品，即《法華經》中所講的《靈鷲山釋迦說法圖》中主尊的描繪。背景的山岩以及空中飛翔的鳥，其中還夾著停留在華蓋上方山頂的禿鷹（參見Fig.66）等則是更有力的證明。
該繪畫殘留部分不到整體的四分之一，这整體畫面只是通过比丘頭部正後方所見絹的綴接針眼推測的。如同Waley講的，佛旁站立的比丘大概是舍利弗。按慣例，中心是整幅絹子，兩邊再接缀半幅絹，当初应是一件很華美的作品，中央位置的立佛身上用橙色暈染，圍繞著絢麗的身光或火焰光，更加襯托出靈鷲山的暗色山岩。佛兩側各有一身弟子陪伴，左右兩側是故事圖。華麗程度，从比丘所站的蓮華座的豪华裝飾，亦可窥其一斑。整體畫面，依然以青、橙色爲主調。
主尊的身份，可以參考刺繡品（還有小型刺繡品，第3卷圖2）以及新德里國立博物館所藏的《靈鷲山釋迦說法圖》、大英博物館的其他藏品（斯坦因繪畫51；第2卷圖11）。而畫面兩側的故事圖，則與千佛洞的壁畫有聯係。如前所述，那些故事圖不僅應在左側，右側也應有描繪。非常有趣的是，左手執衣襟，右手筆直下垂的佛立像，居然出現兩身。一身在左下方的建築架中，有兩個男人貼近佛頭。另一身在左上端接近城壁外側的獨立像，旁邊站著舉起左手的比丘。
這些故事圖的情景，在敦煌第72窟南壁上部有榜題説明的壁畫中得到了更清楚的解釋。壁畫中，中央是釋迦，周邊圍著諸多聖衆，左右的山水圖中佈置了幾身大小不一的佛像。這裏，我們的問題主要在右半部展開的畫面。首先出現的是右半壁畫的左上方的佛像（參照羅寄梅No.072-7）。此場景的解說文是“鐵像從印度來現時”。右邊的佛像比這個佛像還大，頭部殘缺，伴隨著佛弟子和飛天，解說文是“聖容像（木+勿）下去頭時”。隨後中部出現的是被建築架圍起來的這一佛像。一個人爬著梯子，建築架半空有兩個男人，上面也有四個男人支着傾斜的佛頭。解說文是“卻得聖容像本頭安置仍舊時”。
壁畫右上方有若干身佛像，各自都有解說故事情結的榜題，特別引人注目的是上述三個場景，即建築架上的兩個男人進行佛頭修復作業，它們表現的顯然是此繪畫的殘留部分的主要事件。還可舉出若干相同的描繪，如該繪畫建築架正前方繪著青色屋頂的建築物（參見圖22－2），在第72窟中也可以見到，其解說文是“羅漢見聖容碑記時”。遺憾的是，手中所掌握的該窟照片（壁畫下半部全都很模糊，只見一身佛像），無法與此畫的其他部分做充分的比較。在此畫中，還可見到乘著雲彩，手持輪形大鼓的風神和雷神（參見圖22－2，Fig.67），有一隊騎馬著甲的士兵（參見Fig.65），在其上方有騎騾馬的僧侶及負載著經文的大象等（參見Fig.64）。從而，此畫中央描繪的說法佛，不僅僅與最重要的大乘經典《法華經》有關連，也與佛像和經典從印度東漸有關。
 撰寫上文時，恰好M.Robert Jera Bezard來訪，確認了另一件可能是此畫的一部分重要的殘片（高72.0釐米,寬28.0釐米）。看到本圖，他立刻想起了在伯希和收集品中的同一色調的一件斷片（《敦煌幡和繪畫》，圖25）。在這個斷片中，一個菩薩跪在香爐前（參見Fig.63）。根據說明，香爐應該在主尊正下方的位置。實際上，這裏只能在上部窺到顔色豐富的蓮華座的兩片花瓣的尖端。另外，斷片中還繪有樂人一群、兩群騎馬人，比丘五人，以及諸多權貴人物等小像。這些人物和山水風景等的描繪，與斯坦因收集的作品也有關係，但最引人注目的是繪於跪姿菩薩正前方的佛頭，是用綠色描繪，用兩根樹夾起置於長方形的臺上（斯坦因此畫的顔色實際上幾乎完全脫落，但感覺像的顔色是金屬色）。伯希和收集的斷片，描繪的無疑是相同故事的一個斷片，我個人毫不猶豫地認爲，那是此圖的一部分，菩薩像應該連接於本圖大的比丘立像的正下方（參見Fig.62）。從以上的情況，可以推測全圖高170.cm,寬120cm以上，它應該像敦煌第72窟的宏大場景那樣，也有充分的餘地收進相當大的畫面。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

This relatively benign work relates to a manga that he went on to publish from 2004, titled 'Goho Doji' (Young Dharma-defender).  The main character, Goho Doji, is the combination of a boy and girl who become a single being.  The term 'goho' corresponds to the Sanskrit term 'dharmapaala' (Dharma-defender).  Another character in the manga is Fujōbutsurei Dōjo, the ‘young girl who cannot become a Buddha’ who exists in a limbo state neither dead nor alive.
There are many representations of the esoteric Buddhist deity Fudō in the BM collections – notably the late Heian period (12th C) wooden sculpture (1960,0220.1). Fudō has taken many forms in different periods in Japan: there is even an ukiyo-e print by Shunshō which shows the Kabuki actor Ichikawa Danjūrō V in the role of Fudō (this lineage of actors was thought to be ‘living manifestations’ of the deity). It is fascinating that the deity has been used in a popular contemporary manga.
(T. Clark, 8/2011); This painting relates to another by Hanawa titled ‘Manifestation of the Great Deity Hanawa, no. 14’ (Hanawa Daimyōjin go-shintai 花輪大明神ご神体 no14) (BM reg. no. 2011,3028.1).",,Not on display,"Exhibited:

Above the monkey is a half-length figure, probably a turbaned celestial, watching with hands joined. In the upper scene the lower part of the Buddha is turned towards a figure in a loincloth with joined hands standing behind a large narrow-necked jar from which flowers spill on either side. The size and form of the jar are unlike that in the lower scene and the standing figure is not clearly simian and seems almost as tall as the Buddha. The two scenes may be unconnected.

A monkey once made off with the Buddha's bowl, and, having gathered honey up a sāla tree, offered it to the Buddha who, ordering the insects and impurities to be removed, accepted it; the monkey, dancing backwards with joy, looking at and bowing to the Buddha and joining his hands, fell into a well and was killed; the story is subsequently popular in eastern Indian sculpture and eastern Indian and Nepalese manuscript illumination. The Pāli tradition combines it with that of the elephant in the forest of Pārileyyaka, whom the monkey tries to imitate in his care of the Buddha, but here the monkey serves 'stick-honey', accepted by the Buddha when the insects have been removed, and perishes by falling off a branch on which he was gambolling with joy.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and badly abraded.

Lamotte, 1944-80: III, 1346-7 and fn., refers in this connection to a canonical passage forbidding the measurement of a pudgala (person) in connection with an anuvyañjana called anavalokitamūrdhatā (where the head is not to be looked at).

On the far left a small figure with long hair and on top a short horizontal length, looped and secured across the middle with one end pointing up, wearing a girdled paridhāna and uttarīya, turns towards the central figure and holds an opening lotus by its stalk in his right hand. He appears to be a young brāhmaṇa ascetic. In front of him a long-haired old brāhmaṇa ascetic, bearded, with a similar loop of hair on top and an uttarīya, joins his hands in the direction of the Buddha. Behind the monk in front is another brāhmaṇa ascetic with long hair, carved almost on the scale of the Buddha; and beyond the Buddha, again behind a monk, the very large head and torso of a young brāhmaṇa ascetic with long hair and the same style of hair on top as the other brāhmaṇas. Beside the Buddha are three monks in all, two with hands joined and right shoulder bare and one holding a lotus bud by its stalk in one hand, the robe in another and having both shoulders covered. Two appear to have one of the three monastic garments folded over the left shoulder, as in Eastern Indian, Sri Lankan and South-east Asian representations, and marked with rectangles representing the patches of cloth from which monastic garments were prescriptively made, features exceedingly rare in Gandhāra sculpture. In the centre the haloed and dominating Buddha stands almost in three-quarter view with moustache and densely linear hair with the uṣṇīṣa a large bun-chignon bound with a plain band. He raises the open right hand at right angles to the chest and secures the robe with the left hand. Both shoulders are covered and the drapery folds, as on the robes of the three monks, are defined by dense grooves, sometimes overlapping or crossing in a disorganised manner. Beyond the monks and at the far right, corresponding to the lotus-holding ascetic in the opposite corner, stands a woman with tunic, a paridhāna with girdle round it and a scarf running in the narrow mode from the left shoulder. Her hair forms a tall loop, and she wears earrings, anklets and a collar and holds a large opening lotus by its stalk in her left hand. What appears to be a prostrate figure before the Buddha can scarcely be made out except as a broken curved outline of the back, a slightly more defined head and one distinguishable elbow.
Apart from the fact that the Buddha's face has open eyes with a narrow ring of lids and incised pupils, the heads of the other figures are very similar, long to oval, with mechanical modelling, even where the monks' leanness is conveyed in sharp noses and chins and chisel marks, and the eyes are large, rounded and protruding, only rarely showing lids. The effect, perhaps partly due to wear, is of a staring remoteness, also seen in the Buddha.
The young ascetic on the left is, like the prostrate figure below the Buddha, perhaps Megha. They would thus form a scene in continuous narration and, while the position and appearance of the young woman on the far right readily suggest a donor, she may be Prakṛti and the whole composition could then be an early representation of the Dīpaṃkara story, despite the appearance of ascetics, unexplained in this context, unless they are connected with the presence of a fellow student of the Bodhisattva.
The border encloses between fillets an undulating stalk with regular nodes from which stalks branch carrying open lotuses and one bud and one leaf seen from the side. The open lotuses have centrally grooved petals and stamens; at the apex is a small open lotus.",,,,,,,Kushan,1stC-2ndC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: North West Frontier Province,schist,,,carved,Height: 49.20 centimetres; Weight: 34 kilograms; Width: 68.30 centimetres; Depth: 8.50 centimetres,,"Blurton, 1997:
The Dīpaṁkara Jātaka  was a popular story in ancient Gandhāra and is shown here in continuous narrative, that is, with two stages of the story in one relief panel. This was a standard convention in early Indian art, and used throughout the subcontinent as well as the lotus flower meander, which is a motif of long-standing popularity in the arts of ancient India.
The head of the Buddha, with moustache, recalls the Khalchayan dynastic clay heads and the Herus portrait on coins, arguing, together with the general stylistic resemblance with early Swāt valley sculpture of Butkara type, a date in the 1st century AD.; Zwalf 1985
By tradition the future Gautama Buddha, as a young Brahmin in a previous birth, took his Bodhisattva vow to become a Buddha before an earlier Buddha called Dīpaṃkara. Having begged flowers from a young woman (far right), he threw them in homage at Dīpaṃkara and, prostrating himself, spread his long hair for Dīpaṃkara to walk upon.

His straight hair curls on the shoulders, his chest is modelled and his loincloth bulges over the genitals.

He has a fleshy chest and is carved, at least above the waist, in greater relief and on a larger scale than the other figures.

The story of this scene survives in the Chinese canon and was first published in this context by Foucher in a translation by Chavannes. A king of Candravatī, his mind poisoned by the jealousy of his other wives, caused his pregnant youngest wife to be killed and buried. A posthumous son, however, nourished himself from one breast on a half of his mother's corpse not decomposed; when he was three the collapse of part of the tomb released him, and when he was six he met the Buddha and became an arhat. Subsequently he saw and converted his own father and the Buddha revealed their relationship, explaining the recent events from an earlier series in the time of a previous Buddha. The child's name, Sudāya, is restored from the Chinese both in this narrative and in another version, where a pregnant mother dies, is buried in a tomb, gives birth and the child feeds on her milk for seven years before meeting the Buddha and becoming an arhat.
The naked child standing and kneeling is Sudāya, who thus appears in this example, as in others, in continuous narration crouching beside the corpse of his mother and standing before the Buddha; he can also appear only once, beside his mother or standing.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist with crystalline inclusions, broken and exfoliated.

In the next scene a muscular and turbaned figure, wearing a paridhāna and an uttarīya perhaps tied round and hanging down from the waist, a bracelet, an earring and a collar, raises one hand to strike the barrel drum hanging from his left shoulder and further held below by his left hand as he turns to the Buddha.

In the first scene, which may have shown one or more ascetics facing the Buddha, the striding figure is not easily explained. The second scene could be classed with Foucher's
group with drummer representing, with or without a gateway as he later thought, the Entry into Rājagṛha. In the legend episodes with the Kāśyapa ascetics and the visit to Rājagṛha occur close together soon after the Enlightenment. Foucher defines his Entry into Rājagṛha from the Pāli canon as the Buddha and his monks coming for a meal at the invitation of king Bimbisāra when Indra, as a young brāhmaṇa, much admired for his looks, led the way singing verses. A meeting with King Bimbisāra and another with Uruvilva Kāśyapa and the king's invitation to a meal are generally reported at this stage in versions of the legend but while there can also be mention of a messenger (Saṃghabhedavastu) there is none of a musical escort except in the Pāli.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, chipped and with soil incrustation.

(Object),,,"Part of a corner panel with the vestige of one scene and another, complete, showing the Visit of Indra. The haloed and damaged Buddha, in dhyāna, is seated on grass in a deep recess, with gently curved opening, of a mountain, his hands covered and the robe spread out to lie in a straight edge below them. Beneath, a kneeling elephant, with a cloth on its back, holds in its trunk a parasol by the shaft. The mountainside has rounded contours, a damaged lion whose forepaws emerge from a cave and a small tree growing at the top; linear whorls here suggest vegetation, as do the small radiate patches on BM 1880.69, 1917.0501.2 and elsewhere.
On the Buddha's left the three figures are Indra in uttarīya and paridhāna, collar and a turban with a low cylindrical cap, joining his hands, and two others, both with crested turban and half-length, one with hands joined. Balancing them opposite, the harpist Pañcaśikha wears a short paridhāna with a knotted uttarīya round his waist, a high globular chignon with a band at its base above his short curled hair and a necklace; he rests his harp in the crook of his arm and raises his right hand to shoulder level, while two half-length figures behind and above him, one with curled hair and another with a crested turban, are presumably celestials watching. Pañcaśikha is in pronounced relief, his lower legs undercut.
The incomplete scene shows two figures, greatly damaged; the tapering shafts of the framing pilasters have a meditating Buddha on an open-lotus pedestal, the hands covered, below a Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts. The corner pilaster continues onto the side together with the capital and mouldings, but the shaft has an outlined oblong panel with curved top and bottom.

He touches a rectangular stone with his right hand, and with the left, raised to shoulder level, secures the robe in a large loop; gathered drapery hangs below it. High and symmetrically curved ridges mark the drapery folds between the legs and an under-robe is visible. On the right side the damaged hair runs in the ladder mode and on the large uṣṇīṣa are small depressions. Beside the Buddha a half-length Vajrapāṇi with bare torso, an abundant head of large curls surmounted by a damaged chignon, moustached and with narrow eyes that suggest a frowning expression, holds one hand to his chin while his muscular left arm is stretched down to hold a large faceted vajra. Beside Vajrapāṇi are the remains of a standing monk with his robe wound round his right arm; below the monk is a kneeling figure, hands joined, probably wearing a loincloth and a headdress wound round the head and under the chin. Beside the stone beneath the Buddha another kneeling figure with loincloth and joined hands has straight hair under a chignon. On the other side of the stone a disproportionately large figure in a loincloth and with hair curled like Vajrapāṇi's kneels with joined hands; above him a half-length figure with straight hair and a chignon joins his hands, also towards the stone. Beside them a half-length figure with a wrapped headdress also wound under the chin holds one hand to his face, the other grasping a hoe or pick, while beneath him a full-length muscular figure in loincloth and a mannered and perhaps defiant posture, wearing a chignon and a prominent band of curls framing the face, stands with one hand on his hip and another on the trunk of a half-tree framing his side of the scene.

The execution has many distinctive features: the pronounced and expressively angular form of the bodies; their contorted postures; their compression in sometimes flattened planes within the panel; the slight inclination of the columnar stone in the centre and the Buddha's sloping posture, both of which suggest that the Buddha is arresting its fall. The narrow, sometimes slanting eyes and the hairstyle are reminiscent of features that seem to be in a late style and the similarity of this panel with BM 1913.1108.21 is suggestive, given the same donor, of an identity of workshop and site.
Devadatta's murder attempts are summarised below. At the first attempt Devadatta sent men at intervals and in increasing numbers, whom the Buddha successively converted. At the second attempt Devadatta hurled down a great stone, but a yakṣa intercepted it and only a fragment injured the Buddha. Then Devadatta persuaded mahouts to loose Nālāgiri, a fierce elephant, but the Buddha's compassion halted its assault and the elephant paid him reverence.
In the Mūlasarvāstivādin Vinaya, Devadatta's first attempt was to have an engineer set up a contrivance worked by five hundred men to kill the Buddha and arranged for yet others to kill him if it failed; the mechanics repented and, before setting off the contrivance, descended to the Buddha by magic steps and were converted. Trying again with fresh assistants, Devadatta shot a stone from the catapult; Vajrapāṇi shattered it and the yakṣa Kumbhīra lost his life trying to stop a fragment injuring the Buddha's foot.
Foucher's original assumption of a wall separating the Buddha and his would-be assassins, generally adopted although textually unsupported, was first challenged by Hargreaves, 1924-5: 150-3, who proposed to recognise the second attempt only and a stone instead of Foucher's wall. Subsequently Foucher, 1905-51: II, 848 ad 541, proposed to see in representations with his wall, which he now too considered a rock, a combination of the first and second attempts of the general tradition and, in Calcutta G. 10/A23281 and perhaps this example, the Buddha trying to steady a stone; Taddei, 1963a: 40-1, quoting both Hargreaves and Foucher's recantation of 1951, would rather see a 'heavy square stone or pillar' whose fall the Buddha stops than a real wall which in Gandhāra is always shown frontally. Moreover both Hargreaves and Taddei illustrate carvings where the same type of columnar stone or pillar is being manoeuvred into position, not only by itself but also, and evidently in continuous narration, with the more usual representation of the murder attempt with the Buddha beside an upright stone or pillar. While those panels where a stone is being manoeuvred seem close to the catapult story, the representation of the Buddha with the stone and the murderers is less so, for they abandoned their contrivance and descended the mountain by a stair before their conversion; a variant or continuous narration must be assumed.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and worn.

A cult of the turban should presuppose the story of the Bodhisattva's tonsure after the Great Departure. With a sword he cut off his locks (cudā), or locks together with a crest or turban (moli and cūḷāmaṇiveṭhana), crown (mukuṭa) or Mani pearl gem which were taken by Indra and honoured among the Thirty-Three Gods. The ascension, enshrinement and worship of a turban are found on sculpture outside Gandhāra, and in Gandhāra a turban, shown apparently as a cult object, is a persistent motif in sculpture. While the episode of the tonsure itself is scarcely represented in Gandhāra, the turban is brought to the Bodhisattva as he leaves the palace and occurs exceptionally as part of the Exchange of Clothing and when Chandaka returns with it to Kapilavastu.
The present piece may show the Bodhisattva or the Buddha instructing a deity in the worship of the turban or it may have some connection with concepts of royal consecration (abhiṣeka) and more specifically as extended to the final stage of a Bodhisattva's ascent, known also by the term abhiṣeka.

The panel is one of a small group showing a humped bull at the Buddha's feet and, where clear, licking them; a figure apparently its herd or owner and, in two cases at least, a figure offering a purse. This group has been referred by Santoro in two articles first to the Chinese version of a lost Indian original and subsequently to the Divyāvadāna. In the Chinese a bull being led to slaughter ran towards the Buddha, fell weeping at his feet and begged to be saved; the Buddha explained that formerly, as a cakravartin, on encountering a man taken up for debt he had offered double repayment to release him. The money was never paid until, in his present rebirth as a bull, when his purchase price equalled the value of the debt, the Buddha, with the help of Indra, Brahmā and the four mahārājas, offered his owner treasure to fill two bull-hides; the bull came away with the Buddha and in a following human rebirth became destined for nirvana. The Divyāvadāna tells of a bull which, while being led out of Vaiśālī to the slaughter by a butcher, broke his bonds, ran towards the Buddha, knelt and licked his feet; despite the Buddha's urging, the butcher, pleading poverty, refused to spare him until the Buddha, with the help of Indra, provided three times the bull's value.
Santoro (1990), proposing, where Indra does not hold the purse, to see the lokapāla Kubera-Vaiśravaṇa, perhaps justified by the Chinese, does not commit herself to either story and discusses problems raised by ambivalent figural evidence.
For the ambiguous history of this piece see BM 1912.1221.1.; Zwalf 1985
This panel shows a humped bull licking the Buddha's feet, the Buddha's guardian spirit Vajrapāṇi, with thunderbolt, and a turbaned worshipper; a figure crowned like the god Indra offers a bag, perhaps ransom for the bull, to a man with an implement who may be its owner or a herdsman. A panel in Peshawar Museum also shows a humped bull licking the Buddha's feet and attendant figures but no transaction as suggested above. These scenes may be versions of an episode found in a text which makes a characteristic Buddhist point. A monk, who had once abused his hearers for their stupidity by calling them buffaloes, was reborn a buffalo with an ungovernable temper. On seeing the Buddha, however, he fell at his feet and licked them, so gaining a happier lot in his next existence.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

After the passage of the two merchants the Buddha, thinking the Doctrine too profound, hesitated to propagate it, but in his compassion resolved to do so if asked by the crested Mahābrahmā or Śikhī and inspired him accordingly. Śikhī  invited Indra to join him in supplication and they, with the four mahārājas or lokapālas and other gods of various heavens, went to the Buddha who, after hesitations and repeated requests, finally consented. Mahāvastu III.314-20 tells substantially the same story without naming the Mahābrahmā further while the parallel story ibid.: I.230 makes a Mahābrahmā the only supplicant in Dīpaṃkara's case; Brahmā is the principal supplicant in Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra (Lamotte, 1944-80: I, 57-60) and is alone in Saṃghabhedavastu I.129. In the Pāli tradition the Mahābrahmā Sahampati is the only supplicant. In the Jātaka Introduction (Fausboll, 1877-97: I, 81, translated Rhys Davids, 1925: 206-7) he is accompanied by many gods but he is alone in canonical accounts (Malalasekara, i960: II, 1080 s.v. Sahampati with references).

A certain nāga's prospect of salvation depended on a Buddha coming into the world and he therefore devised a set of questions which only a Buddha could answer. When this happened he paid homage to the Buddha first 'in his own natural body' and then as 'a Manava youth'.
For this story in continuous narration on the Prasenajit Pillar at Bhārhut see Bachhofer, 1929: I, pl. 23 (letterpress with the Chinese story) and Luders, 1963: pl. XXXIX, where the nāga or serpent appears three times, twice in human form with a five-headed serpent rising over his head and once as a five-headed serpent. Representations in Gandhāra fall into a number of types. One shows the nāga kneeling before the Buddha in human form while behind him, in a fenced tank, a figure with joined hands may have a serpent rising behind it. Perhaps this is a case of continuous narration with the same nāga in serpent and human form or, as Foucher believes, the nāga as human and his daughter still in serpent form and in the tank.
Another type shows the serpent in animal form before the Buddha's seat and in human form to the Buddha's far right (Peshawar I7I6) beyond seated monks. The lost left side of the present piece prevents it from being grouped with Peshawar 1716 where continuous narration presumably explains the two forms of the nāga. A third version (Bombay 22), without monks, shows a nāga in human form directly to the Buddha's right, as serpent before his throne, while an ascetic with a damaged water pot stands on his left; this distribution may recur on the damaged Bombay 21 (AIIS 131-68) where a serpent appears below the Buddha's seat and an ascetic with a water pot stands on his left, but none of the other figures now shows the attached serpent.

To his right a figure in uttarīya and with a small top-knot or chignon on a shaven head holds, in his left hand, a skull with a large eye cavity visible, while his right hand, with a bracelet, palm inwards and fingers curled towards the thumb, is held in front.

This piece belongs to a group first recognised by Taddei (J979: 395-420) in which a central Buddha is flanked on his right by a brāhmaṇa with topknot emerging from his wrapped head and, opposite, by a monk, each holding a skull; in his examples the brāhmaṇa consistently holds his right hand as here but the Buddha's gesture varies and in one case the facing monk is replaced by a lay figure without a skull. A shaven head with a topknot occurs only on the above.
The underlying story was quoted by Taddei from the Pāli. It tells of a  brāhmaṇa who, by tapping the skulls of the dead, could determine in which destination they had been reborn. In the Buddha's presence he correctly identified four rebirths, but could say nothing about the skull of an arhat and he therefore joined the Order to learn the secret. In a comparable account in Sanskrit the skull-tapper is the son of a ṛṣi and an antelope and, having a head like an antelope's, is called Mṛgaśiras; Ānanda puts him to the test with four skulls and, when he fails over the last, an arhat's skull, brings him before the Buddha who explains that the liberated have no destination; he becomes a monk and attains nirvāṇa when the Buddha demonstrates the uncertainty of life as demonstrated by the monk's inaccurate predictions of rain.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and chipped.

Beneath three leafy branches the Buddha is seated in abhaya on a rectangular seat with a simple plinth, three four-petalled rosettes on its face and what looks like a high grass cushion. The robe shows dense folds, mainly in ridges, and below the loop in the Buddha's raised left hand gathered drapery spreads down to the seat. The head is in high relief with open, slightly slanting eyes. The uṣṇīṣa is bound by a fillet and the halo has a border formed by an inner groove.
To the Buddha's right a figure seated in European fashion with a chignon but no halo, wears earrings, a necklace, a paridhāna and an uttarīya almost entirely covering the lap and legs. The right hand lies over the left in his lap. The figure opposite, similarly seated and dressed, is, however, haloed and has a necklace and a crested turban. His left hand is on his lap, his right raised to the turban.
Beside the branches on the left is a figure with a bag formed from his uttarīya and held in his left hand, while the right is raised to throw flowers from it, and on the right is Vajrapani, holding a long vajra in both hands, his beardless head slightly raised and with staring, rounded and protruding eyes.

Although the figure on the Buddha's right is unhaloed and wears ornaments, this scene shows similarity with panel 5 from the Sikri stupa at Lahore for which Foucher claims as subject the Buddha in the Trayāstriṃśa heaven, not otherwise noted in Gandhāra. The haloed and turbaned Indra, the king of the Trayāstriṃśa heaven, has the Buddha on his right and, as at Lahore, Vajrapāṇi and a flower-throwing deity are present. The other ornamented deity, if not Brahmā (compare BM 1917.0501.1), would, following Foucher's suggestion for the Sikri panel, be Māyā reborn as a god. By Foucher's criteria, however, the Buddha's left hand is not in the appropriate gesture of exposition attributed to it on the Sikri panel and Indra's damaged hand-gesture, perhaps pensive, replaces the abhaya of the same scene.

The cutting of all the figures and details is stiff and sometimes sharp, with grooves and ridges to define drapery folds; the heads are round and full, the eyes rounded and protruding. This is one of a small group of pieces showing a varying number of monks, all with their right shoulders bare, of whom one sometimes carries a spouted pot and one regularly presents a circular seat. For examples see Swat V.422, an incomplete scene with three monks, one with hands joined, another carrying the seat draped as far as a distinct arcaded motif below; Chatpat 44, on which five monks approach the Buddha, one with the draped seat showing only convex mouldings at the bottom. The same presentation recurs in the iconography of BM 1914.0502.1. Examples are San Francisco (B6o SI); a piece in private hands where monks approach a disc with petalled rays and hold a seat barely showing at the bottom an undulating motif below the low drapery; yet another example of such an offering places the Buddha beside three wheels on a column and touching or turning a large wheel behind it (Kurita, 1988-90: I, fig. 272). On this piece an arcaded motif seems visible on the seat but a similar piece, Columbia 80.202 (Nagar, 1981: 10-11), although heavily abraded, seems to show the type of the almost totally draped seat. Dani tentatively suggests that Chatpat 44 shows the offering of a seat before the First Sermon, although a rectangular seat is offered in the few cases where a connection with the First Sermon in the usual iconography is certain or probable. The rectangular seat recurs on fragments where the connection can only be presumed but may also be found with a variant of BM 1970.0602.1. It is striking that round seats associated with iconographies discussed in BM 1914.0502.1 and BM 1970.0602.1 can be almost wholly draped as well as showing a construction suggesting that of the cane seat of Bodhisattvas and other persons.
The attribution of this piece to the cycle of the First Sermon can be only tentative, given that it stands on its own, that the numbers and attributes of the monks in the different examples vary and that the iconography of the scenes associated with BM 1914.0502.1 and BM 1970.0602.1 may still be thought uncertain. A further context for the presentation of a seat has yet to be established.
The presentation of a seat occurs when, after determining where and to whom to preach the First Sermon, the Buddha went on a begging round at Benares and then directed his steps to the Deer Garden at Sarnath where the five bhadravargīya ascetics, once his companions in mortification of the flesh, saw him coming. Since he had abandoned their joint quest for salvation, they first wished to deny him all honour and welcome, but as he approached their resistance left them and one took his bowl and over-robe, another offered him a seat, yet another a footstool and another water for his feet.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and with soil incrustation.

After the Buddha had taught his mother and the gods in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, he returned to Jambudvīpa, surrounded by gods, at Sāṃkāśya and there was a magnificent display of men, gods and of a cakravartin magically created by (the nun) Utpalavarṇā. The tradition that he came down on a central ladder flanked by Indra and Brahmā, each on his own ladder, and accompanied by deities, is, with variations, found in Pāli and sources of northern origin. Usually in the texts Brahmā's ladder is of silver and Indra's of jewels and they are on the right and left respectively; the monuments seem to agree that these positions are with reference to the Buddha. At their foot the Buddha was greeted, in the Pāli tradition, by Śāriputra and Utpalavarṇā.

Noteworthy is the elongation of several figures in the panels.
The framed columns have Corinthian capitals and, above, between fillets, is a motif of heart shapes.
Along the whole length of the panel is an upper classicising register of figures in illusionistic poses difficult to distinguish in detail. Two women at least seem bare to the thighs with one hand on the hip and the other raised to the shoulder; several males, some appearing in motion, wear tunics under cloaks covering the shoulders and upper chest and one figure advances holding a large shield and with one hand raised to the shoulder.

Lamotte, 1944-80: III, 1343-4 (fn- 3) lists with references, also to the monuments, five forms of the literary tradition of the Bodhisattva's Bath before or after the Seven Steps: 1. A hot and cold stream of water falling from the sky; 2. The same but of terrestrial origin; 3. The same produced by the serpent kings Nanda and Upananda in the sky with Indra, Brahmā, the four lokapālas and other deities who bathe and sprinkle the Bodhisattva with variously perfumed waters and flowers; 4. The order inverted with Indra and Brahmā in the sky, bathing and sprinkling, followed by the serpent kings associated with the two streams and assisted by many other gods; 5. The serpent kings alone bathe the Bodhisattva with perfumed waters.
Representations of the Bodhisattva's Bath in Gandhāra usually agree in giving the child central position, under a parasol and often on a form of tripod stand and haloed, Brahmā (left) viewed from the back, and Indra (right) with inverted water pot to each side, while a flanking female may stand or kneel beside the child. Additional flanking deities of Brahmā and Indra type also occur. Panels of this subject showing wholly ophiomorphic nagas are very rarely reported. The attendant figure with palm branch, common at the Birth, appears to be on Swat WS 125, but seems unreported elsewhere with the present subject.

The haloed Buddha sits on a low seat in the centre of the panel, his over-robe on both shoulders; the neckline is in relief and somewhat plunging, the drapery folds in regularly curving and rounded ridges. He raises his right hand as if in abhaya with a seed or fruit (a mango) in the palm, and his left hand rests in his lap with gathered drapery undulating and spreading on the seat below. His long head is turned to his right, the eyes markedly narrow and slanting and the abundant hair drawn back from a peak over the forehead into a large uṣṇīṣa. His halo is large and plain and the leaves on the variously curving branches above him are long. His low seat appears to have a cushion and a flattened dentil-and-drop ornament above the plinth.
On the Buddha's left, Vajrapāṇi, with long, bearded face, modelled planes of musculature, genitals, a long draped overgarment from his left shoulder passing across the legs, holds a faceted vajra with rounded ends in his left hand and raises a fly-whisk like a torch in the right. Behind him are three ascetics; one with his back to the viewer, and with a short girt tunic over the left shoulder and hair gathered in a chignon on the top of his head, raises one arm and holds by the hand another, blind, bearded ascetic of emaciated appearance, wearing only a short lower garment and with hair loosely coiled into a wreath-like headdress. Between and above them a half-length ascetic with an apparently shaven head and a length of hair looped at one end and tied down in the middle points with his index and middle fingers joined and thumb extended upwards at the Buddha's miraculous action. On the Buddha's right another emaciated but vigorous-looking bearded ascetic of similar dress and coiled hairstyle strides forward with hands cupped to receive the fruit. Behind him, in a hut with a curled finial, another, possibly blind ascetic of similar dress and hairstyle sits on a stool with curved legs on which he supports himself with one hand while he holds a long curved pole in his right. His emaciation is emphasised by a sharp re-entrant angle below the ribcage. Balancing the half-length ascetic opposite is another figure, of youthful appearance, emerging from behind the hut.

Drapery folds on all the figures and the wings of the spirits or kiṃnaras show dense grooves which recall the early 'drawing' style of Butkara. 
In a number of instances a disc, radiate or plain, receives worship in a context where the cult object is often an attribute such as the Buddha's turban or bowl. Occurring on caitya arch friezes or over the upper compartment of false gables, these cases have encouraged the interpretation, extended to a Mathurā panel, that the disc, in order to qualify as attribute of Buddha, should be a halo. But discs occur in a more varied range of examples and many appear rather to symbolise the Buddha himself, especially in connection with events of the First Sermon. Thus the present scene becomes more probably an episode from that cycle; some examples, as if the force of the symbol is insufficient, show a pair of knees behind the disc, yet others the disc with the Buddha also, and yet others again a disc with another symbol, such as the three wheels or a tree.
For the disc as the Buddha's halo see Pal, 1984: 139, and Carter, 1988b: 29. A proposal to identify the disc as a solar symbol of the Buddha is based on a sky- and fire-symbolism connected with concepts of ascent and personal liberation (Enlightenment), return and salvation (First Sermon).",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Green schist, broken, chipped and worn.

Despondent figures with ascetics can sometimes be referred to the Visit of the Sixteen as on V&A I.S. 81-1949 (Acker-mann, 1975: 126-7, pl- LVa) and Russek, 1987: no. 52, but in the episode on Chandigarh 1058 the Bodhisattva may be visiting brāhmaṇas soon after the Great Departure (Foucher, 1905-51: I, 374-9, fig. 191).

Lying on his side, head turned to his right and feet away from each other, the Buddha holds his right hand, apparently emerging from the high neckline, as if in abhaya below his head and against the bordered halo. His left hand is covered by the robe, which continues in pleats below it. The hair is wavy into the uṣṇīṣa, the long oval face has partly open, expressionless eyes.

The features are sharply, if clumsily, carved, the faces sometimes heavy, the noses prominent and broad and the mouths set back between jowls.
The Indian texts agree substantially over the Buddha's last days. He became seriously ill near Vaiśālī but was able to reach the Malla country, near Kuśinagara, where Cunda, the smith, prepared him the mysterious sūkaramaddava which again made him ill. Proceeding to Kuśinagara, he lay down on his right side between two sāla trees, his head to the north, and the trees flowered unseasonably. Ānanda attended, grieving, gods assembled and the Mallas of Kuśinagara were summoned, coming in great numbers. The ascetic Subhadra was the Buddha's last convert. When the Buddha was dead, Brahmā, Indra and the monk Anuruddha (Aniruddha) recited verses, monks grieved and the Mallas came to honour his body. They could not lift it for the cremation until Anuruddha had indicated the gods' wishes and it would not burn until Mahākāśyapa, informed on the road by an ājīwika, had arrived with his followers and it then caught fire spontaneously. The Mallas took possession of the remains and would yield none to claimants among the neighbouring tribes who prepared to fight, until a brāhmaṇa had effected a peaceable division; then each erected a stupa in his own territory to enshrine a share.
In representations of the Great Decease the usually haloed Buddha lies invariably on his right side, his covered left hand down his side, the right palm outwards beside the head; a leg can be flexed and the drapery may hang as on a standing figure. The bed, with turned or carved legs, may have a mattress and pillow and a textile, sometimes decorated, hanging between the legs; a small stool also occurs. At each side one of the traditional pair of sāla is represented by a tree, commonly with evenly paired leaves on the branches, and there may be more. Attendants may include Brahmā and Indra, usually Vajrapāṇi, figures indistinguishably gods or Mallas unless, as in Calcutta 5147, they are half-length and flying figures and throwing flowers, and monks identified as Ananda, Anuruddha and Mahākāśyapa. Vajrapāṇi stands at the head of the bed as here and in the following piece, or behind it, or lies beside it, raising one arm in a gesture of grief or holding it across the top of his head. Usually at the foot of the bed is a figure with a wrapped head and a triple staff (tridaṇḍa) or a monk with or without monastic staff, the monk sometimes touching the Buddha's feet or in conversation with a naked and tonsured figure, while the figure with the triple staff, the tridaṇḍin, may be talking with a monk behind or beside the couch. To explain this confusing alternation it has been proposed that the monk behind or beside the couch may be informing the tridaṇḍin of the momentous event or he may, by a use of continuous narration, be Mahākāśyapa, who arrived seven days after the death, learning of it on the road from an ājīvika, the naked and tonsured figure, or, in a sculptural tradition found on Gandhāra reliefs, from another kind of heretical personage instead, the tridaṇḍin. Sometimes a standing monk helps up another; they are identified as Anuruddha and Ānanda. Another figure, variously seated, facing, with back to the viewer or in three-quarter view, and sometimes tonsured, as here, and sometimes with his head covered is identified as Subhadra, the last convert. When this figure has beside him a tripod of three sticks tied to each other to support a suspended bag, explained as a water bag, the reference must be to Subhadra's previous character as a parivrājaka ascetic.",Srinivasan 1997 / Gandharan Textiles: a Local Craft with a Western Connection; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/dc51a/s3),"Exhibited:

(Object),,,"Top scene of three on an upright showing the Buddha standing and flanked by Brahmā and Indra. The haloed Buddha stands frontally in slight flexion, his right knee forward, the broken right hand originally in abhaya, the left pendent and covered in the over-robe. The neckline is tight and the drapery folds are mainly ridged. His head is oval and full. To the Buddha's left and turned towards him stands Indra, a haloed figure with crested turban, collar, uttarīya, paridhāna, hands joined and right knee flexed. To the Buddha's right Brahmā, a taller haloed figure with an uttarīya in the narrow mode, curled hair surmounted by a chignon, joins his hands. Above the latter a half-length figure with an uttarīya and a coiled chignon on one side or the back of the head raises an arm (to throw flowers); a corresponding figure with curled hair opposite also raises an arm. The faces are fleshy and full with narrow eyes.
The second scene down shows an encounter with a drummer. The haloed Buddha stands flexed in almost three-quarter view to the entire height of the scene, his damaged right hand in abhaya, his left hand securing the robe at his side, both shoulders covered and the robe edge in relief from the raised wrist to the left hand. Two undergarments are visible. The raised neckline is tight and the backthrow distinct. The Buddha's head is long and oval, and the inner features are asymmetrical; the uṣṇīṣa is bound at its base. The damaged drummer appears to wear a loincloth with the trace of a strap from his left shoulder for the banded barrel drum, which hangs obliquely so that his right hand strikes the top and his left hand the bottom. The figure stands in a flexed posture and has muscular legs contracted under the knees. Above him a figure raises an arm to throw flowers. Beside the Buddha a monk wearing a similar tight-necked robe secures it in his left hand and above him is another figure with one arm raised and a bowl-crop hairstyle.
The bottom scene of the upright shows the story of the dog.Unlike the other figures, the Buddha stands the full height of the scene but lowers his haloed head to address the animal. His over-robe covers both shoulders with a high neckline; his abhaya hand appears directed at the dog, while his left hand secures the robe a little above waist level and the edges in between stand out in some relief. The quite dense drapery folds are in a series of terraces. The Buddha's head is oval and the face full-fleshed with narrow eyes, the hair runs in almost straight lines into the uṣṇīṣa which has a fillet round its base. Squatting in front and looking up at him is a hairy and tailed animal, the undercut and nearer foreleg straight, the farther flexed. Behind it stands a monk with his right shoulder bare, the tonsured head thrown back, the features sharp. A half-length figure above with curly hair and round head bends forward, raising an arm to throw flowers. Beside the Buddha Vajrapāṇi, softly modelled, with clear features and with muscular legs narrowed at the knees, wears a lion's skin over the top and back of his head and secured across his chest by the forelegs, and a loincloth, perhaps the knotted hind legs of the skin. The flat vajra is held to his left shoulder by its narrowed middle and bottom. Another celestial above Vajrapāṇi has sharp features, narrow slanting eyes and a severe bowl-crop hairstyle. The expressive angle of the Buddha's body and the halo, almost detached from the back, enhance the sinuous character of the carving. The scene is flanked on one side by a half-pilaster with a summary Corinthian capital and the usual base mouldings under a sawtooth cornice. Along the right edge is a scrolled stalk with full-blown five-petalled rosettes.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 7.10 centimetres; Height: 17.20 centimetres bottom scene ; Height: 16.80 centimetres second scene down ; Height: 14.30 centimetres top scene ; Height: 55.20 centimetres; Width: 16.60 centimetres bottom scene ; Width: 16.50 centimetres second scene down ; Width: 16.60 centimetres top scene ; Width: 21.10 centimetres,,"The top scene could be a depiction of the Descent from the Trāyastriṃśa heaven (see BM 1917.1009.12) in an abbreviated representation. For another instance of a standing Buddha with Indra and Brahmā but without a stair interpreted as the Descent see Hargreaves in Marshall, 1951: II, 715, no. 110(a), and in, pl. 219, no. 110, where Indra's standing on the Buddha's right is acknowledged as being at variance with his usual position on the panels and the textual evidence that describes Indra's stair as on the Buddha's left.
Perhaps the second scene down of the upright shows the same subject as the left-hand scene on BM 1880.103.
The Buddha, entering the house of Śuka Mānava, son of Taudeya, saw his dog, Śaṅkhakuñjara, on a couch eating. When he saw the Buddha, Śaṅkhakuñjara barked, provoking from the Buddha a reproachful allusion to a previous encounter which so angered the dog that he sprang off the couch into an open drain below it. Thus Śuka found him on returning home and, angered by what he was told of the Buddha's words, sought him out and asked about the dog's previous existence. The Buddha explained that Śuka's father had been reborn as that dog and, to prove it, bade Śuka order the dog onto the couch to eat and, when he had obeyed, to show Śuka the treasure he had not revealed at the time of his death. Śaṅkhakuñjara leapt off the couch and, in another old room or building, he scratched and sniffed between the four legs of a couch, thus revealing four iron pots of gold. Śuka now returned to the Buddha in a favourable state of mind and the Buddha explained to his hearers that Śuka's rebirth, if he now died, would be as happy as it would have been grievous if he had died discontented towards him on account of his reproach to the dog. The iconography of this theme seems to fall into three groups: (a) as here where the animal is on the ground; (b) where the dog sits or stands on a seat or couch as in Peshawar 794 (Ingholt, 1957: fig. 120), 35L (Kurita, 1988-90: I, fig. 364), Lahore 1139 (ibid.: I, fig. 365); and (c) where two dogs, one on and another beneath a couch, must indicate continuous narration, as in the following piece where there is further discussion.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, slightly broken, worn and with some soil incrustation.

The figures are rounded with a slight and elegant elongation. On the right the preaching Buddha is attended by a monk with right arm slung in his robe, the other pendent and wholly covered by it; his long oval face is modelled and the hairline marked.

This scene may represent the story of Bāvarī's sixteen pupils or Pārāyaṇika brāhmaṇas. An ascetic named Bāvarī, distressed on account of a curse, was consoled by a female spirit and sent sixteen of his disciples with their following to test the Buddha's Buddhahood by certain questions, and they duly became arhats; the Buddha then appeared before Bāvarī, who also became an arhat.
A number of sculptures have been referred to this story; a mountainous context is common to most, which either situate the Buddha in a cave, as in the Visit of Indra, or on an uneven rocky surface, and the ascetics adopt mannered and indeed dejected postures; the gesture of touching the head, which here suggests a salutation, seems elsewhere like burying the head in one hand. For the presence of guardian figures see Raducha, 1985a, who considers that BM 1965.0801.5 may have a connection with this subject.
A previous explanation of this scene, the preaching of the Sermon on the Senses to the Kāśyapas after their conversion, was proposed for this panel on account of the mountainous setting and its possible equation with Gayāsīrṣa (Gayāsisa). The ascetic appearance of the Kāśyapas after their conversion would be anachronistic, but for a comparable problem in respect of BM 1899.0609.21 see Foucher, 1905-51: II, 274-5.; Zwalf 1985
Seated on a hill, the Buddha may be preaching to some of his first converts, the Kāśyapa hermits, still shown long-haired. In the Pali tradition the Buddha is said to have addressed them, after they had become monks, on Mount Gayā (Gayāśīrṣa). 'Everything is burning . . . with the fire of lust. . . of anger . . . of ignorance. . . . Considering this . . . becoming weary of all that [the disciple] divests himself of passion ... is made free. . . . He becomes aware that he is free . . . and that there is no further return to this world.'",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

Kālika and his consort Suvarṇaprabhāsā are almost in profile, both with hands joined. Kālika wears a crested turban, an uttarīya and paridhāna, with one thick robe end swinging forward and a five-headed serpent rising above his head. Suvarṇaprabhāsā has a wreath headdress, a garment from her left shoulder, a paridhāna round it and a scarf, and above her head a broken, probably single-headed serpent indicates her nature. Behind Kālika's arms rise two lotuses on separate stalks and below him, incomplete, is the blown-petal ornament on the side of the nāgas' pool from which the flowers may be supposed to rise. Beside the Bodhisattva, Vajrapāṇi, in three-quarter view from the back and naked to the waist, holds the vajra in his left hand. Two damaged, probably male figures stand beside Vajrapāṇi, and above him, barely half-length, turbaned deities are observing. On both sides the lost shafts of the pilasters probably also once had worshipping amorini, as in the upper scene, and above the Corinthian capitals is a bracket capital with one voluted bracket arm only.

The encounter with the nāgarāja Kālika occurred on the way to the bodhi tree, when the splendour from the Bodhisattva's body illumined Kālika's palace and Kālika spoke verses foretelling the inevitability of the Enlightenment; Kālika's wife, Suvarṇaprabhāsā, along with serpent maidens, showered the Bodhisattva with flowers, jewels and so on, and also spoke verses of praise. In the Pāli tradition the nāgarāja Kāla hears the Bodhisattva throw a bowl into the Nerañjarā and, as it strikes the bowls of previous Buddhas, praises him and predicts the Enlightenment. The present subject and the Submission of Apalāla can be represented with a similar iconography (see 214, Lahore 1057) when the nāga couple appear in an enclosed pool or spring, but the Apalāla subject is usually distinguished by a second Vajrapāṇi in a posture of assault or menace against the nāgas and the Buddha may appropriately be accompanied by monks; for the Kālika subject fenced enclosures seem usual, while Apalāla can appear on rocks, in water and so on.

After the seven weeks' meditation and fasting that followed the Enlightenment, a large caravan belonging to two merchants called Trapuṣa and Bhallika was suddenly stopped in its tracks when it approached the neighbourhood of the tree under which the Buddha was. When they had seen him, the two merchants offered food, the four mahārājas each brought a stone bowl and the Buddha caused the bowls to become one, leaving only lines below the rim to show that there had been more bowls.

To distinguish between compositions with the three wheels (an innovation confined to Gandhāra) as cult object and as symbolising the First Sermon, Foucher, 1905-51: I, 427-31, proposed that the presence of deer, even when flanking and worshipping monks are standing and kneeling rather than seated, indicated the latter, but instances are now known which may favour grouping scenes with the three wheels, but lacking the deer, more closely with the cycle of the First Sermon. This may appear from Taxila Kn. '32-302, an incomplete panel apparently in the usual iconography but without deer (Marshall, 1951: n, 717-18, no. 119, III, pl. 220, no. 119), from the apparently narrative context provided by a harmikā and from single panels among which the Buddha himself may stand beside the three wheels and in many cases turns or touches another wheel or disc, while monks bring a seat as on BM 1940.0713.4 in connection with BM 1914.0502.1. Also common are the simultaneous representation of the three wheels and a single wheel or floral disc in the combination of 'trident' over disc, and here deer are also sporadically present.
The symbolism of the three wheels has been explained by Benisti, 1977, 65-6, with textual references, not as the Three jewels of Buddhism but as an allusion to the three turnings of the wheel at the First Sermon. In the many different examples of scenes with the three wheels, the meaning may seem to vary between a representation of the Doctrine in its First Sermon aspect and one which is more rather than less narrative, with the Buddha present and turning or touching a wheel or disc and sometimes a monk bringing a seat. In both cases the monks are worshippers instead of auditors. Unless five monks were certain, the present example would seem to be rather of the former type.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"2010/11 14 Oct- 3 Apr, London BM, Images and Sacred Texts: Buddhism across Asia","1.Grey schist, broken and exfoliated.

Having dismissed Chandaka and Kaṇṭhaka and cut off his hair, the Bodhisattva, wishing to adopt more suitable garments, exchanged his Benares silk for the rougher clothes of a hunter.While the Tonsure may occur before the Farewell from the horse (Buddhacarita, Saṃghabhedavastu, Mahāvastu), the adoption of rough clothing, although in some accounts previous to the departure of the groom and horse (Buddhacarita, Jātaka Introduction), is the Bodhisattva's last act in this sequence of events. The Tonsure appears to occur only once in Gandhāra, on a limestone relief from Qunduz where the order of events is: the Farewell, the Tonsure and the Exchange of Clothing (Fischer, 1958: 238, fig. 4).

(Object),,,"Panel showing the Offering of Dust. The haloed Buddha, filling the height of the scene, turns looking sideways and down and leaning somewhat forward, his right hand and arm stretched out before him, palm inwards, while the left hand holds an empty bowl sideways and open to the viewer. The over-robe covering both shoulders with a high, slightly pointed neckline hangs with edges in relief from the right forearm and in a dense fall from the left wrist, and reveals more of the lower undergarment but less of the upper than is usual. The drapery folds are regular and densely rounded ridges. The hair undulates into the large uṣṇīṣa. Beneath the bowl a standing child, almost naked save for a cloak round the neck and hanging down the back, a low girdle, bracelets and anklets, wears earrings and a fillet above his short border of curls and holds out both hands on which apparently lies a flat cake. Beside him another similar child, naked except for ornaments, hair with a low chignon, sits cross-legged on a moulded threshold or plinth with damaged hands joined.
Above the standing child are two half-length turbaned figures, one above the other, both wearing ornaments and an uttarīya. Also on the threshold and framed in an oblique and fasciated doorway with a hint of sloping jambs stands a woman wearing a diaphanous sleeved blouse, a garment over her left shoulder and a paridhāna round it, a cross-hatched wreath-and-large-flower headdress with a loop of hair projecting above it, and the usual ornaments; instead of the palm branch she holds peacock feathers in a cylindrical mount upright in her left hand while her damaged right hand is raised. The lintel is enriched with a sawtooth pattern under a cavetto cornice of vertically grooved lotus petals and above it is a balcony draped in a textile. On the balcony are two women like the one below, one raising an arm to throw flowers. While the oblique doorway may suggest a variation of depth, the balcony is entirely frontal and the threshold almost so.
Beside the Buddha a Vajrapāṇi of Hermes type, with one flexed leg, turns away towards a monk; he is naked except for a draped overgarment looping below the plump thighs and revealing an otherwise svelte figure with modelled chest, one damaged arm raised, the other cupped under the rounded bottom of his vajra. His hair is short with corkscrew curls below the fillet. The monk's tonsure shows a hairline, the over-robe covers both shoulders, his right hand is covered, the other resting on the chest. A similar monk is above him and above Vajrapāṇi is a half-length ornamented celestial with wavy hair and a chignon, holding thumb and index finger of the left hand to the mouth in wonder while the right arm is raised, the thumb, index and middle fingers joined and pointing upwards.
The panel has flanking pilasters with large Corinthian capitals in distinct parts, appropriate base mouldings with tori rather straight in section and, on the shafts, curving garlands with tied ends top and bottom and carved respectively with an overlapping petal and cross-hatched leaf pattern. Above the Corinthian capitals a capital in distinct upper and lower tiers with sawtooth enrichment supports a sawtooth cornice; the framing fillet below is plain.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 7.10 centimetres; Height: 39.70 centimetres; Width: 53.60 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:

The subject of the Presentation of Dust is told in the Divyāvadāna and recounts how two boys of good family, called Jaya and Vijaya, were playing in the dust and saw the Buddha on his begging round. Jaya gave him a handful of dust, calling it (coarsely ground) meal, while Vijaya expressed approval by joining his hands; on Jaya's pronouncing an aspiration (praṇidhāna) to universal monarchy, the Buddha predicted his rebirth one day as the emperor Aśoka.

Although empty, the eyes are sharply outlined and the faces carry hints of expression; the central female would seem to be almost smiling, while her companion on her left has a solemn considering look.
The suggestion that this panel represents the Presentation of the Bride to the Bodhisattva is recorded without contradiction or enthusiasm by Marshall. If such an identification is to be hazarded, the portly bearded figure may be the father of the bride or bridegroom, the leaner figure with a garland the family priest, and the woman between them Yaśodharā.; Zwalf 1985
By tradition the Bodhisattva married and this relief, with a woman standing in the centre, is interpreted as the presentation of the bride; on her left may be the family priest or her father. The model was perhaps a secular drinking scene.

(Object),,,"Stupa drum panel showing the Birth of the Bodhisattva and the Return to Kapilavastu in two scenes read from right to left. Māyā puts one arm round her attendant's back and raises the other to the soffit of the cornice without grasping any visible branch or foliage. She wears a paridhāna and her long overgar-
ment perhaps as a looping scarf, bracelets, earrings and a chignon at the side; the infant emerges above the lower garment with arms stretched down towards the swaddling cloth which Indra strides forward to proffer, while behind him Brahmā joins his hands. Both wear uttarīya but in different modes, Indra has a crested turban, Brahmā a chignon. Maya's attendant bends awkwardly forward in her short-sleeved tunic with her scarf apparently passing over her left shoulder; a chignon is at the back of her head. Beside her is a tree.
In the next scene a covered chariot drawn by two lions shows the swaddled infant cradled in the lap of a woman seated in front and facing the viewer. A male head looks on above the typically maned Gandhāra lions with their pendent tongues. The chariot seems to emerge at an oblique angle from behind the divider, but the lions are pulling it into line behind a horseman with knee-length sleeved tunic and trousers; he raises one arm in the direction of the chariot, towards which he and the stationary horse have turned their heads.

While the Lalitavistara tells of Māyā's death seven nights, and the infant Bodhisattva's return to Kapilavastu in a chariot seven days after Māyā had left the town, the Mahāvastu describes the return of both from the Lumbinī Grove in a conveyance made by Viśvakarmā, artificer of the gods, and carried by the four mahārājas; the Bodhisattva and his mother climb into it. The chariot may be pulled by lions, as here and in the following piece, by horses or by bullocks.; Zwalf 1985

On her way to her parents at the close of her pregnancy the queen entered the Lumbinī garden where, as she grasped the branch of a tree, the child emerged painlessly from her right side and was received by the gods Indra and Brahmā. He stepped to the ground, announcing that he was the foremost in the world and that this was his last birth. The queen was supported by her sister.

The Buddha is here more frontal than in the preceding piece, his feet are covered and his right knee is flexed forward; his robe, over both shoulders and covering his left hand, has regular curving and rounded ridges for drapery folds. The wavy hair continues into the uṣṇīṣa. His face is long and oval; the lids of the closed eyes meet in a slit. Under his right hand is a full pillow with a bobble, the side of the mattress has an undulating groove and a textile hangs between the turned legs with a wide pleat in the middle.
In front of the couch a monk, perhaps Ānanda, his right shoulder bare, supports himself on the ground with one hand and stretches out the other. Beside him, turned almost in profile, an apparently meditating figure, presumably Subhadra, with wrapped head and both shoulders covered, corresponds to the seated frontal figure in the same position in BM 1889.0715.9. The monk at the head of the bed, Anuruddha, with a bare right shoulder, visible undergarment and concerned expression, the tonsure lacking a hairline, advances towards Ānanda and probably extended an undercut arm now missing; his left arm is flexed indistinctly with the hand to, or above, the shoulder. Beside him Vajrapāṇi, a grieving old man with a broad chest, raises one arm over and across his head, which is turned away from the Buddha. He wears a short paridhāna and his uttarīya knotted as a thick scarf over his thighs, and his legs are undercut. His face is distinctly, almost finely, featured and two rows of curls over his lined forehead cover an otherwise bald head. The faceted vajra in his left hand lies against his shoulder. Above Vajrapāṇi is a tree with evenly paired leaves on the narrow curving branches and above the monk a mourner, both arms raised and ornamented, notably with armlets beside the shoulder, and wearing a small chignon and an uttarīya, looks on in grief.
Behind the Buddha is a damaged figure on rather a larger scale than the others. He has a broad flat chest under a large damaged head with earrings and short curls dramatically thrown back; he brings his undercut arms, with armlets just beside the shoulders, together behind his head; his eyes are long, open and set above high cheek-bones. To his left two figures, ornamented and with uttarīya, one with a high crested turban, the other with arms folded and possibly a chignon over a short hairstyle with a curled border, appear to be in conversation; another figure, in particular relief, turbaned and ornamented and with a grief-stricken face, brings one hand to the side of his head. Behind them are damaged half-length figures. On the flowering tree with narrowing trunk the lower branches are undercut.
Below the tree two figures converse: a monk almost in profile, right shoulder bare and an undergarment visible above undercut legs, a small 'embonpoint' below a broken arm, faces another figure with his right hand lifted, an undergarment also visible but his over-robe, which leaves the right shoulder bare, covering the gently inclined head, the backthrow passing round the neck. In the figure with a draped head and usually a bundle of sticks and talking with a monk in scenes of the Death cycle Foucher supposed that an ascetic of the tridaṇḍa-carrying order had replaced, in announcing the Buddha's death to Mahākāśyapa, the naked ājīvika of the piece in the previous catalogue entry, but in certain scenes learning of the circumstances before meeting Mahākāśyapa.

This panel contrasts with BM 1899.0715.9 in detail and delicacy, rounded cutting, composition and proportions.
The damaged figure behind the Buddha is perhaps a deity; other instances of a mourner, of large and energetic appearance, are seen elsewhere and also behind the bed among the gesturing Mallas or deities. On Peshawar 2084 a central figure with similar gesture has whiskers and an unusual headdress (turban). On Lahore 1037 a prominent central figure is the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, but the corresponding figure on Peshawar 775 has a turban and an uttarīya. For the size of the head see the same feature on Swat Butkara 2892 (Faccenna-Taddei, 1962-4: II, pl.

The seated and haloed Buddha, wearing an over-robe over both shoulders and with a curved neckline in relief, touches the seat with his right hand and secures the robe above his lap in his left hand, from which the gathered drapery spreads in the usual way. The folds are defined by grooves. The Buddha's head is oval with sharp-cut features and narrow eyes below wavy hair in vertical curled bands under a high uṣṇīṣa. Behind it are a large plain halo and above, following its curve, a canopy of branches and distinct pīpal leaves. The strewn rectangular seat has a moulded plinth and a cross-hatched face behind a radiate wheel set on a vertically grooved pedestal flanked by couchant horned deer, their backs to the wheel but looking round at it. Beside the Buddha four monks with robes over both shoulders sit on similar rectangular seats aligned obliquely to his. Their heads, where undamaged, are thrown back and all have both hands covered in their robe and in their lap except for one monk who raises his right arm, wrapped in his robe, and joins his first two fingers vertically while the thumb and remaining fingers cross the palm. This distinguishing feature may be compared with the extended hand of a monk on the Buddha's right on Calcutta 5054, in whom Foucher (1905-51: I, 433) would like to see Ājñātakauṇḍinya, the first arhat; see also Faccenna-Taddei, 1962-4: I, 20 ad pl. LIVa. One monk, now almost headless, between two on the Buddha's right and with no visible seat, makes up the traditional five. Their robes lie in straight or semi-circular edges between the knees, and the faces of their seats have hatched or triangular patterns. Above the monks and beside the tree, celestials with long hair, a chignon, an uttarīya, a collar, earrings and bracelets join their hands or raise them to throw bunches of flowers. One, between two monks on the right, balances the monk opposite.
All the heads are oval, with emphasised chins and lower lips and rounded protruding eyes, and the tonsured monks have a hairline. Compare in general, and in such details as the angle of the first monk's head on the Buddha's left, Peshawar 1716.4
Framing the panel at the top is a register between fillets of acanthus leaves with drooping central lobes and flanking points joining those of adjacent leaves. Defining the bottom are mouldings with sawtooth enrichment, except where cramp mortises were perhaps subsequently made at the expense of the ornament.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Height: 27 centimetres; Weight: 8.60 kilograms; Width: 32 centimetres; Depth: 7 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The Buddha set rolling the Wheel of the Doctrine with his First Sermon to the five ascetics, always shown as monks, in the Deer Park outside Benares. They and numerous deities were converted and rejoicing gods reported that he had set rolling the thrice-revolved and twelvefold wheel of the Dharma.
In Gandhāra the wheel of this scene is found in a variety of positions against or beside the Buddha's seat, very often distinctly to the left to be beneath the Buddha's right hand; the deer beside it symbolise the location. No tree is mentioned in the texts but, although on the sculptures there is always one behind the Buddha, it varies and, like the deer, must, if more vaguely, refer to the setting. The auditors are usually five or fewer monks, often seated at an oblique angle; and various figures, of deities and of Vajrapāṇi, are used to balance the composition of a central Buddha and an uneven number of monks.
This is almost certainly the panel discussed in Barger and Wright, 1941: 20, as having pīpal leaves, celestials and the earth-touching gesture referable to the Enlightenment, while the monks and the wheel-and-deer belong to the First Sermon: the iconography is therefore deemed composite as on V & A I.M- 70 to C-1939 (Ackermann, 1975: pl. LXXXIa) with the same anachronistic combination of monks and pipal leaves.; Zwalf 1985
After the Enlightenment at Bodh Gayā, Gautama, now a Buddha, went to the Deer Garden at Sārnāth, near Benares, and preached his First Sermon, expressed as 'setting in motion the Wheel of the Doctrine', to the five ascetics who had shared his quest and privations. Before his seat is a symbolic wheel flanked by deer; around him sit the ascetics as monks, one making a gesture of benediction or acceptance, and gods beside a tree rejoice.","Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Cocheteux & Takahashi 1995 / Sérinde, Terre de Bouddha.

In the right-hand scene the Buddha, towering over all other figures, has to his left Vajrapāṇi, and above and between them is a half-length onlooker in a crested turban. The damaged Vajrapāṇi holds his right hand to his hip and the vajra vertically in his left hand and appears to be looking up at the Buddha. His torso is muscular, his arms and legs very slender and his short lower garment is densely pleated and hangs with a thick excess of cloth between the legs. The Buddha's over-robe, covering both shoulders, apparently conceals his hands; he stands, head lowered, right hand raised to touch that of the striding male figure who, as he advances, holds up a flower or flowers; he is seen from the back and the head, hair clearly short, looks upwards and sideways over the left shoulder. He wears a uttarīya and paridhāna. A young woman, wearing ornaments, stands turned towards him, her right wrist perhaps held by the male figure, while her left hand brings its index finger to her mouth. She wears a garment passing over her left shoulder, a paridhāna round it and a scarf draped round the elbows as it falls from the headdress, which seems to consist of a wreath with a flower to the front and a coil and loop of hair above it. Beside her, almost full-length save for the legs, is a spectator or deity with long hair in a chignon and an uttarīya worn wrapped round the right arm.
In the incomplete scene a male figure kneels, one knee only on the ground which the head, showing a chignon, almost touches, back curved and wearing only a paridhāna, in front of a woman who appears to emerge from a doorway oblique to the scene, hands joined, dressed like the woman in the right-hand scene except for the single wreath of her headdress. A third figure, wearing an uttarīya and a turban with a crest on its side, turns beside the door towards the tall Buddha who appears almost compressed between the upper and lower frames, his head inclined and his damaged right hand held across the body while his left hangs free of the garment. Above the doorway is an ornamental cornice of lotus petals pointing upwards, but the architraves are too worn to show clearly whether they have ornament.
The framed columns have the usual base and a Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts. Above is a sawtooth cornice and below a plain framing fillet.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Jamalgarhi,schist,,,carved; painted,Diameter: 4.90 centimetres; Height: 17 centimetres; Width: 46.70 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The eyes of the figures are shown as rounded and protruding, except for those of the Buddha which are thin narrow slits between lids. Noteworthy are the naturalistic treatment of Vajrapāṇi's torso and the bold use of the partial back view in the right-hand scene.
It is tempting to see here perhaps a rare Dīpaṃkara sequence in two successive and separate frames as against the preponderance of representations using continuous narration. The transactions with the Buddha and the young woman are, however, obscure, and the young male appears to lack a chignon in the first scene and might be thought, if he were Megha, to have loosened his hair in the second where it still seems short. Compare BM 1880.68, 1980.0225.1, 1880.208, 1899.0715.11 and 1892.0801.7. Identification must remain in doubt, although the two scenes may well be connected.
In an early photograph this fragment seems to be in the same condition as now and appears together with BM 1880.103. For their connection with Lahore 820 and Chandigarh 730 see Errington, 1987a: 340-2, and figs 199-201. The present and following pieces appear to fit the same circumference (c 4.75 m) and show similarities of treatment, especially of the male in three-quarter view with mannered prominence of his buttocks, but the difference in the base of the divider column in the following piece is noteworthy.

From right to left an incomplete scene shows a figure, apparently female, perhaps in a draped garment with a wreath headdress and a loop of hair, carrying a textile folded in the middle.
In the next scene the Bodhisattva on horseback emerges from an oblique and moulded doorway, wearing a crested turban and an uttarīya and holding the reins. An incomplete halo is carved on the lintel. Two yakṣas appear as busts from the ground and pass their arms around the horse's hooves; on the horse's head is a globular ornament. Above is the head of a turbaned deity or spectator and in front of the horse a damaged turbaned figure in uttarīya turns towards it in a curved stance.

(Object); The Invitation of the Śākyas. (Object); The Intervention of Ānanda. (Object),,,"The top scene perhaps shows the Invitation of the Śākyas. The haloed Buddha, shown on a larger scale than the other figures, is seated in abhaya, both shoulders covered, the neckline prominent and tight, the over-robe with folds defined by grooves, some paired, and the edge from the right forearm curving in relief down to the gathered drapery on the seat from under the left hand. The head and neck are long and the wavy hair continues into the large uṣṇīṣa. Beside the halo leafy branches hang downwards. The Buddha's high and strewn seat is otherwise plain. On his right is a kneeling monk, damaged hands formerly joined and right shoulder bare, between two watching half-length figures with garments apparently over both shoulders; on the Buddha's left a monk, seated with one leg at an angle suggesting a kneeling rather than a crossed-leg position, wears the robe oyer both shoulders, with the hands in dhyāna and covered. Between him and the Buddha, to judge from the tonsure, is another monk. The heads are long and oval, the features sometimes sharp and the eyes rounded and protruding.
Second scene down of four on an upright, with the Dīpaṃkara jātaka in two incidents. The Buddha Dīpaṃkara stands with an outstretched hand in abhaya to the full height of the scene, his left hand securing the robe at waist level. Both shoulders are covered, the neckline is high and in low relief and the usual undergarments are visible. The hair is in wavy strands and with a seemingly coiled uṣṇīṣa. Megha appears twice. As a standing figure, holding flowers in his hands, he has long hair and a chignon, drapery wound round his left shoulder and upper arm, and a lower garment with a girdle; his chest and arms are muscular. He is then shown almost on all fours before Dīpaṃkara with his right forearm lying on the framing fillet below. Behind Megha stands a woman with a garment over her left shoulder and a girt paridhāna round it, a collar and anklets, a high chignon, and holding a flower in her raised right hand. Above her and beneath the bracket arm from the pilaster a rectangular projection with two faces in double outline may represent a lintel rather than a balcony. Beside Dīpaṃkara and looking away from him stands Vajrapāṇi with short hair, a short lower garment, powerful arms and torso with horizontal bands of musculature; one hand is on his hip, the other holds the bottom of a long vertical vajra between thumb and finger(s). Another, monastic figure faces him. Below the top of the panel are three complete tops of spectators with chignon and tunic and the vestige probably of another. All the heads are long and oval, the features sharp and the eyes rounded. At one side a sharply cut pilaster, the shaft with a recessed oblong panel with curved top and bottom, has a Corinthian capital under a capital with sawtooth enrichment and one voluted bracket arm and, below, the usual and summarily moulded base. The pilaster continues on the return but the bracket capital extends to the edge of the Corinthian capital only. Above the panel and also continued on the return runs a cavetto with acanthus leaves, each with a drooping lobe in the middle and lobes at the sides with points meeting those of the next leaf.
The third scene down of the upright shows perhaps the Intervention of Ānanda. The haloed Buddha sits with his over-robe covering both shoulders and forming a high neckline; an edge in relief falls from the arm of his abhaya hand and joins the gathered drapery from his left above the lap. His neck and head are long and the high uṣṇīṣa of wavy hair is secured by a fillet. The strewn seat is plain and high, and leafy branches hang down beside the halo. On the Buddha's left a woman in almost frontal position with a small chignon and fillet, a garment passing over her left shoulder, a paridhāna round it, and a scarf over her left arm looped into the girdle and anklets, holds a cylinder bound horizontally at the top, middle and bottom, perhaps a garland of flowers suspended by a cord rather than a cylindrical vessel as offering to the Buddha. Between them appears to be a figure with wreath headdress and beyond both a damaged male lay figure in uttarīya and with joined hands. Above them are half-length figures, one with a chignon and another in a turban. On the Buddha's right are two monks, both with their right shoulder uncovered and one in discourse with the Buddha, his right hand before his chest, his pendent left under the robe, the other with hands joined. Three half-length figures, two with crested turbans, look on above and beside them.
The fourth scene down of the upright shows the Buddha before a doorway. The haloed Buddha, almost the height of the frame, one hand in abhaya, the other, which is damaged, to his side, his over-robe covering both shoulders and with a tight neckline, stands slightly turned to his left, his hair like stray locks under a tight uṣṇīṣa. Above him a celestial holds a wreath, the edge marked with petals. Beside the Buddha a figure, in crested turban and uttarīya in the wide mode and a gathered robe end swinging away, stands elegantly in front of a doorway pointing to it. In between them the head, with chignon, of a robed celestial looks on. The oblique doorway is lower within its moulded architraves than the figure in front of it and its door of two panelled leaves appears partly open. Above the doorway triangular loopholes and a balcony projecting on brackets must belong to the same building. Beside the Buddha, Vajrapāṇi, partly turned away, wears his uttarīya in the wide mode and holds his vajra at a slant at the left shoulder; his hair is short. Beside him a monk has his right arm wound in the robe but apparently no hand emerges. Above them are two half-length celestials, one looking outward, robed over both shoulders, the other seen in three-quarter view from behind, with long hair, a chignon and an uttarīya; he extends a damaged arm, evidently to hold, with the figure opposite, the Buddha's wreath.

Common to traditions of the Buddha's first visit to Kapilavastu is the intervention of Udāyī; according to one, when the Buddha was at the Bamboo Grove at Rājagṛha soon after the Enlightenment, his father Śuddhodana sent Kālodāyī or Udāyī the Black together with the groom Chandaka to invite him and 'with bent knees and bowed head Kālodāyī implored the infinite One'. They became monks and, at a suitable season for travelling, persuaded the Buddha to return to Kapilavastu. In the Pāli and Mūlasarvāstivadin traditions repeated failed embassies were followed by the success of Udāyī alone who invited the Buddha to Kapilavastu, himself becoming a monk, in the latter tradition after Buddha's assent to Śuddhodana's letter. 
For what may have been a similar garland, but held as on BM 1899.0609.21, see a woman on the Buddha's left on a damaged panel of an upright (Delhi 68.183, formerly Lahore 4(W)), where, however, the figures opposite are lay, one with hands joined.
It seems impossible to identify the fourth scene down as the invitation
of Śrīgupta; scenes attributed to this subject show the Buddha always and his followers sometimes on lotuses, and a welcoming figure before a door.  A follower of heretics, Śrīgupta invited the Buddha to a poisoned meal and before his door dug a trap containing burning coals.

A fall of gathered drapery spreads onto the seat. The dense drapery folds are sometimes paired; the figure of the Bodhisattva is broad and rather fiat. The head is oval, the features somewhat worn. He sits under a semi-circle of branches on a rectangular strewn seat with sawtooth enrichment and a low plinth. To his left a half-length figure with a large round face, protruding rounded eyes and abundant hair holds something. To his right emerges the bowed head of a bearded Vajrapāṇi, wearing a fillet and with flat vajra; farther to the right, a damaged figure of Māra turns away, looking back over his shoulder, while another figure holds him by the wrist; Māra is turbaned, wears a paridhāna, collar and necklace, armlets and, by a baldrick passing through a suspension bridge on the pointed tapering scabbard, a sword with a globular pommel. The figure holding him wears an uttarīya, a paridhāna and a collar. Above them watch two naked demons with large heads and staring eyes, one with animal's ears and abundant long straight hair, the other with shorter curled hair and an open mouth with fangs.

Under a trapezoidal roof with sawtooth cornice supported on columns with the usual Corinthian capitals and base mouldings, Sundarī, Sundarananda's (or Nanda's) wife or bride seated and wearing a tunic and a paridhāna round it, a scarf over her arm(s), a long chain necklace with pendant, anklets, bracelets, an earring and long undulating hair, looks at herself in a mirror, one damaged hand raised. She is flanked by three women similarly dressed and adorned, their hairstyles varying slightly with the style of the diadem and the height of the chignon. One of them raises a hand with the index and middle fingers joined, another is dressing Sundarī's hair, while a third looks on, almost as if from above. All three have expressively smiling and eager faces, their eyes wide open; a fourth, similarly dressed, stands in a side chamber with one hand raised, her eyes narrow and looking down. The mirror is on a turned stand beside a covered unguent box on a table resting on a Corinthian capital, its lost pedestal supported on a stand of curved legs. Hanging from floral stems, a wreath encloses a bag. In the side chamber beside the door, Sundarananda, haloed and with a chignon, collar, earrings and bracelet, wearing an uttarīya and a paridhāna, carries a bowl and looks back over his shoulder. He reappears in continuous narration just beyond a doorway, kneeling, still holding the bowl and with head raised towards the tall and haloed Buddha who looks down at him. He wears the usual three garments, ridged and terraced for drapery folds, his damaged right hand in abhaya, his dense wavy hair continued into the uṣṇīṣa. Like the women, the Buddha and Sundarananda have open eyes and animated expressions.
The palace superstructure is supported on columns, and, flanking the trapezoidal roof, above worn lion-headed corbels, the balconies have openwork faces, a sawtooth enrichment under the coping and heads of watching women like those below. A scroll runs along the door frame over which are capped battlements with triangular loopholes. A male wearing a turban with a crest at the side leans over them and raises a hand over the Buddha (to throw flowers).

Versions of the story underlying this representation are found in the Pāli tradition, in Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan.
The Buddha is on his begging round at Kapilavastu and his half-brother Sundarananda (or Nanda), made to carry the Buddha's bowl and urged to return soon by Sundarī, follows him reluctantly, is prevented from returning and, though unwilling, accepts to be ordained. His true conversion occurs later after the Buddha, by his magic power, has made him see the superiority over Sundarī of the apsarases of Indra's heaven and he is then shamed by an elder of the community out of trying to possess them by the power derived from the practice of austerities. Before taking him to Indra's heaven the Buddha caught him attempting to escape by causing the tree behind which he was hidden to rise in the air.","Simpson 1894 / The classical influence in the architecture of the Indus region and Afghanistan; Nara 1991 / NHK Daiei Hakubutsukan 4: Indo, Bukkyo bijutsu no Kaika; Errington & Cribb 1992 / The Crossroads of Asia  [Cat. of an exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge]; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Rawson 1984 / Chinese Ornament: The Lotus and the Dragon; Errington 2017a / Charles Masson and the Buddhist Sites of Afghanistan: Explorations, Excavations, Collections 1832-1835",Not on display,,"1.Limestone, broken, chipped, rejoined from three pieces and with bottom left pilaster base restored.

Asita, a bearded old man on a round and draped cane stool, holds a child in his lap. In front of him stands a woman, possibly holding a spouted water pot, and beside her stands another with a branch.

The carving is everywhere summary and the figures are crude; few details are altogether certain. The old ṛṣi Asita, who lived in the Himalaya with his nephew Naradatta, on perceiving signs that the Bodhisattva had been born, predicted to Naradatta the child's destiny as Buddha or cakravartin. They then went to Kapilavastu; Śuddhodana brought the child and Asita examined him and held him in his lap, weeping at the realisation that he would not live to benefit spiritually from the child's certain Buddhahood. The Pāli tradition is very similar.
The presentation of the infant Bodhisattva to Asita follows the formula of the Interpretation of the Dream (see BM 1931.0711.1) and shares variations with it; in the presentation, however, together with an old ascetic who, unlike the old man in the Interpretation, is properly Asita, seated to the left and with his youthful attendant or nephew Naradatta behind, an infant must be present and Asita usually holds it; the seated parents make various gestures and a figure stands in between, holding the infant or presumably just having done so. Altogether exceptional here are the figures with water pot and branch, attributes regularly associated with the Birth; if the parents were ever present, they must have been on the preceding panel on the stupa drum. 
The elephant in this unusual combination may be explained by reference to the Youth cycle: when the now youthful Bodhisattva is about to show his martial skills, a large white elephant is brought to Kapilavastu and Devadatta kills it out of jealousy.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/dc9b/s1),,"1.Grey schist, broken, worn and cracked.

The fragmentary scene on the right shows part of the Buddha's couch, a turned leg and the Buddha's head and right shoulder, his head against a plain halo and resting, beside his hand, on a pillow. The Buddha's face is very indistinct under wavy hair and the uṣṇīṣa. Below the bed a prostrate grieving figure raises an arm from the elbow. Beside the head of the bed Indra stands, under a tree, in three-quarter view wearing a low and ornamented cylindrical cap, an earring, a collar and an uttarīya in the narrow mode. He holds one hand to the side of his head, fingers on the forehead and thumb to the ear in what may be a pensive gesture. A tall figure next to him in uttarīya, collar, earring, bracelet and turban joins damaged hands.
In the next scene a stupa on a rectangular base has columns at the four corners, those at the back indicated by repeating in low relief the capital elements only. On the side of the base, above the plinth, is a diaper of four-petalled flowers, while the columns have plain shafts under flattened globular capital elements horizontally grooved. The two large drums, the upper drum set back above the lower, are enriched with acanthus and support a dome with a barely visible false gable panel on the side, a vedikā register at the bottom, and a lotus with stamens above. The damaged harmikā is surmounted by a tapering spire of four parasols and a finial with pleated banners on either side. Beside the stupa are worshippers in crested turban, ornaments, uttarīya and paridhāna; the farthest from the stupa is holding a reliquary, while the two beside it join their hands. Vestiges of a tree remain on the left.
The stupa in this context is commonly represented with two or four persons: they may be layfolk, layfolk and monks or monks only. They normally join their hands and sometimes several carry relic caskets, although the legend requires one deposit only to a stupa.
The scenes are separated by a double frame enclosing a column with a Corinthian capital, a base like a squat pot on a plinth and a narrow band round the shaft.

(Object),,,"Stupa drum panel showing the Dream of Māyā, the Interpretation of the Dream and the Departure from Kapilavastu in three scenes read from right to left under two horizontal decorative registers. In the first scene Māyā lies on a damaged couch and on her right side with her left arm raised to her head beneath a haloed elephant whose trunk joins her back. While Māyā is under a ttapezoidal roof, a female guard with spear stands under each flanking arch. The columns are Persepolitan; in the spandrels are eagles with spread wings and, at the sides, standing lotuses barely carved.
In the next scene Śuddhodana and Māyā sit on a shared draped seat turned towards a bearded old ascetic with chignon; Māyā may hold a lotus, Śuddhodana's right arm apparently rests on the seat. Between them, replacing the column, a head emerges which balances imperfectly the standing female figure on the right of the couple; both are waving crescentic tans. The couple sits beneath a central trapezoidal roof with a cross-hatched curtain or 'punkah' drawn up into it, While the ascetic and flanking figures are under arches. In this panel there are three columns, probably with Corinthian capitals and again with birds and flowers in the spandrels.
In the third scene, presumably showing Māyā setting out for the Lumbinī Garden, a chariot drawn by two horses moves to the left, a woman with wreath headdress sits between the two high lobes of its side, which are decorated with honeysuckle palmettes, and a guard in front carries a spear and patterned shield. The scenes are separated by framed amorini on pot bases and under foliage, one taking flowers apparently from a bag formed in his robe.
Above the scenes is an ovolo with garland enrichment under a vedika register with a lotus-petal coping below a register of caitya arches on Corinthian capitals of truncated pilasters perhaps representing horizontal ""S"" shaped brackets; each arch contains a seated monk.

This relief was once part of a larger panel which, in all probability, featured a Buddha figure at the centre and the Bodhisattva Padmapāṇi on the opposite side. The Buddha flanked by two Bodhisattvas was a common arrangement in Buddhist sculpture from early in its history. The representation of Vajrapāṇi shows that his iconography, at least in ancient Gandhāra, was in part derived from Hercules (see 1776.1108.2) who often wears a lion-skin in the same manner, recalling the hero's defeat of the Nemean Lion. Hercules was widely venerated as a hero and saviour in western Asia during the early centuries of the present era. As a great champion, who nevertheless understood the human condition, Hercules was easily assimilated into Mahāyāna Buddhism.
This relief, aside from its interest as a document of religious development, illustrates a well-known phenomenon in the history of art, namely, that images change in meaning before they change in appearance.; Zwalf 1996:
The manner of wearing the lion's skin is common in the iconography of Heracles (see Lexicon, 1981-8: iv, 7281F., 79iff.) and it derives from his slaying of the Nemean lion; the same style was adopted by or for rulers claiming descent from Heracles, among whom was Alexander the Great.

Once clear of Kapilavastu, the Bodhisattva handed his jewels and parasol to Chandaka, cut off his hair and bade the groom and the horse depart. The horse licked his feet, but the Bodhisattva went away, paying no attention. In the Buddhacarita the horse licked the Bodhisattva's feet, shed tears and received consoling words, and in the Saṃghabhedavastu he licked the Bodhisattva's feet, was stroked and consolingly spoken to. The Lalitavistara speaks of a stupa to mark the dismissal, otherwise briefly reported, and while the Pāli tradition of the Jātaka Introduction tells of Kaṇṭhaka's death of grief at the place of parting, in Sanskrit accounts Kaṇṭhaka died of the same cause later and the return of horse and groom to Kapilavastu is recorded in sculpture.

The bare torso shows rounded breasts and abdomen, the left knee is flexed and the head is oval with open eyes between the lids. Below, the same figure is shown prostrate, the back, with its flattened planes, arched above the ground, one arm and leg carried onto the lower frame and the hair clearly being spread onto the ground with Megha's left hand; his left arm continues the angular outline of the back. Above and beside the balcony is a radiate aureole showing Megha in low relief, kneeling, his right knee on the ground, hands joined, his hair now fastened into a chignon.
In front of Megha is the damaged Buddha Dīpaṃkara shown as larger than all the other figures, wearing the usual monastic garments with neckline in relief. He raises his large right hand with long fingers in abhaya, his body a gentle curve. Behind him are the half-length figure of a monk observing and an armed figure standing in almost three-quarter view, lower legs crossed, back turned to the viewer. His long hair is secured by a fillet and his curving moustache on the upturned face conveys, with his rounded staring eyes, a fierce expression. He holds his long sword by its pommel, the scabbard is suspended through the bridge at its middle from his right shoulder by a baldrick which continues round the front of the body; a short lower garment is secured by a girdle. The doorway has a sawtooth enrichment on the inner jambs, a cavetto cornice with vertically grooved lotus-petal ornament and a beam protruding at the left.
The frame consists of a sawtooth cornice and at one side a pilaster with a Corinthian capital in two distinct parts, the upper, with central leaf and corners, rather high under an upper capital of two tiers with sawtooth enrichment; on the shaft a garland with narrow ends hangs without visible attachment and under the usual base mouldings seems to be a second plinth. The plain framing fillet at the bottom is grooved as if in continuation of Megha's hair, but see also under the pilaster.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Height: 42.20 centimetres with dowl ; Height: 40.30 centimetres without dowl ; Width: 47.90 centimetres; Depth: 9.50 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
In the frame of the extended story in the Mahāvastu of Dīpaṃkara, Buddha Śākyamuni's predecessor, many details parallel the legend of Śākyamuni, but the king is Arcimat and the city Dīpavatī; the Bodhisattva whose Buddhahood as Śākyamuni Dīpaṃkara predicts is Megha. Megha saw Dīpavatī in festive array and learnt from a brāhmaṇa girl, Prakṛti, that Dīpaṃkara was awaited. From her he obtained, also to honour Dīpaṃkara, five of the flowers she was carrying in a pitcher in return for marriage in future births, a condition without effect on the Bodhisattva vow he made on seeing Dīpaṃkara arriving in procession; both Megha and Prakṛti threw their flowers which remained suspended all around Dīpaṃkara's head, stalks turned inwards, Megha spread his robe on the ground, threw himself at Dīpaṃkara's feet and wiped their soles with his hair as he made his vow. As Dīpaṃkara predicted its fulfilment, Megha rose to the height of a palm tree, threw his cloak over one shoulder and joined his hands in homage. In the Pāli tradition the Bodhisattva, Sumedha of Amaravatī, joined in preparing the road for Dīpaṃkara's visit to the town of Ramma(ka) or Rammavatī and, on seeing Dīpaṃkara, spread his mantle and hair, lay down in the mire like a bridge of planks and resolved to become a Buddha rather than reach only Nirvāṇa. Dīpaṃkara foretold that he should be Śākyamuni and offered him eight handfuls of flowers. The summary account in the Dhammapada Commentary to vv. 11-12 omits any Bodhisattva vow and instead makes the act one of especial courtesy (translated Burlingame, 1921: I, 193-4).
With no sure exceptions [Peshawar 1847 (Ingholt, 1957: fig. 188) may seem to be an exception], representations of this theme use continuous narration and Megha can appear up to four times when he obtains flowers from the girl, throws them, lies prostrate and levitates. His commonest appearances are throwing flowers and lying prostrate, while the transaction with the girl is often implied by her presence as onlooker, usually on the left of the panel and often framed in a doorway; Megha also usually faces Dīpaṃkara from the same direction, and when levitating he may kneel, sometimes in a halo, as in this panel, or is apparently upright, but examples of an almost horizontal flying figure seem confined to Japanese collections. In some instances Megha's hair is clearly spread below Dīpaṃkara's feet, but Foucher distinguishes Dīpaṃkara's treading on it, as in the Divyāvadāna, and Megha's wiping Dīpaṃkara's feet as in the Mahāvastu, which is shown by Megha's hand on Dīpaṃkara's ankle. Dīpaṃkara is accompanied by one or more of his monks (both Mahāvastu 1.231 and Divyāvadāna (c.250) refer to large numbers), but Vajrapāṇi is not invariable.
Megha is the name used for the brāhmaṇa student in the Mahāvastu account; in the Divyāvadāna he is Sumati and in the Pāli account Sumedha. In the completely different frame-story of the Divyāvadāna (Dharmarucyavadāna) c.246-53 the king is Dīpa, the city Dīpavatī and the future Bodhisattva is Sumati. All flowers at Dīpavatī had been requisitioned by Dīpa to honour Dīpaṃkara, but the lotuses in a young woman's pitcher rose up through Sumati's merits and she gave him five, keeping two, in return for the promise of marriage in all future births. When thrown, their flowers formed circular canopies that moved or stood with Dīpaṃkara, and in a muddy place Sumati asked Dīpaṃkara to stand on his ascetic's hair (jaṭā) in token of Sumati's future Buddhahood; when Dīpaṃkara did so and affirmed it, Sumati rose the height of seven fan-palm trees.

Flanking yavanīs or female guards turn symmetrically inwards, legs flexed, wearing a knee-length tunic over a paridhāna, a large loop of hair at the back of the head, a collar and earrings; each holds a spear in one hand and the other arm is akimbo. A half-length female stands behind the couch.
In the next scene Śuddhodana and Māyā share a high draped seat, their legs pendent, and turn towards a bearded old man interpreting the dream, who addresses them from a similar seat. Māyā wears a long tunic and a draped overgarment, earrings and necklace and seems to hold a lotus in her right hand; Śuddhodana, turbaned, in uttarīya and paridhāna, leaving the chest bare, crosses his legs at the ankles, the broken right forearm raised. Both have footstools. The old man, hair in a high coiled chignon, also with legs pendent and with a water pot, raises an arm towards Śuddhodana, his head tilted back. A youthful ascetic behind in a short tunic, long hair under a chignon and holding a water pot, flexes his other arm to rest the palm of his hand on his right shoulder.

The traditions agree that when Māyā had told her dream to her husband, he summoned astrologers who predicted that her child should be a Universal Monarch or Buddha according to whether he remained in the world or renounced it.

Two figures are badly sliced: at the back is presumably Madrī with what looks like a loop of hair and a flower in the wreath headdress; the middle figure seems to hold the reins with one hand while the other is raised to the top of the head in astonishment; and the third, complete and male, with the ends of the hair waved or rolled over the forehead, and wearing an earring, collar and armlet, stands forward in the chariot with one hand raised to the top of the head and the other holding a bag of treasure for the Bodhisattva to give to the brāhmaṇa.
The Bodhisattva, leaning forward at an angle expressing his eagerness to give, wears armlets, bracelets, collar, earrings and long hair with a chignon at the top and bound back by a fillet. His left hand grasps an indistinct object, perhaps a small bag, while his right hand is raised and stretched out holding a damaged narrow object. It descends indistinguishably into the brāhmaṇa's outstretched hand where it may be interpreted as cascading from an emptying bag. The ascetic is the largest figure, and his head is bowed beneath the upper frame. He wears a girdled paridhāna with paired drapery folds and his long hair is drawn back and raised into a high chignon. His body is supported on a stick and his emaciated side is densely grooved to show a rib cage above the thrust-out abdomen. The eyes are large with big lids, the nose sharply cut and the mouth an asymmetrical line, making the face look wholly ungracious. The centre of the action is emphasised by the undercutting of both forearms.
Behind him, almost frontal, is a young ascetic, the legs crossed below the knees. He has long hair with a chignon, a girdled lower garment, a brāhmaṇa's sacrificial thread, a water pot in his left hand and the right raised to shoulder level, showing the palm below curled fingers. Like the small figure
on the chariot his eyes show a distinct and heavy-lidded treatment which, with the rolled ends of the hair and perhaps paired drapery folds, suggests late and post-Gandhāra work.
The chariot appears to have trellised openwork sides and its large wheel partly emerges behind the nearer horse, which stands exposed along its full length facing the action while the other, inner horse seems to turn to face the viewer. Both are harnessed, the nearer horse with a saddle; the girth, breast-plate and crupper are beaded, the two latter adorned with radiate 'phalerae' or discs; bells hang at the front and the reins are undercut below the mouths. One mane is dressed into a short comb, the other is more abundant. The nearer horse's flat flank emphasises the compressed carving within a restricted space.

Connected accounts of the conception or dream of Māyā generally agree in representing Queen Māyā as sleeping and her husband as absent. The Bodhisattva, seen in a dream as an elephant who enters her womb, is superb and white and sometimes six-tusked. The question whether Indian sculptural traditions saw the descent of the Bodhisattva in the form of an elephant as dream or as physical reality has been discussed with reference to the varying testimony of the texts.; Zwalf 1985
The conception of the historical Buddha took place when his mother, Māyā, consort of the Śākya chief Śuddhodana, saw in a dream a white elephant enter her right side.

The incomplete upper scene contains a chamber with a couch under a trapezoidal arch flanked by the remains of two arches probably on the Corinthian capitals usual with this feature. The Bodhisattva, one leg pendent, the other raised and supported on the edge of the couch, raises his right hand; his wife lies behind him.

In the Mahāvastu account (II.I 59-64) the Bodhisattva, repelled by the sleeping women, asked Chandaka for his horse and left despite his pleas; no one woke, the gods rained flowers, the earth trembled and the four mahārājas held up Kaṇṭhaka's hooves while Supratiṣṭhita the yakṣa, with his five hundred companions, opened a city gate; wicked Māra grieved, hosts of nāgas and suparṇas escorted the Bodhisattva who, before the sorrowing city-goddess, swore not to reenter the town before his Enlightenment. In the longer Lalitavistara account deities, in a preamble, prepared their various parts and Vaiśravaṇa in particular told the yakṣas to carry the horse's feet while he went ahead, and Indra undertook to open doors and point the way. The gods then showed the women in repellent attitudes and the Bodhisattva, seeing the gods and planets ready, summoned Chandaka; despite his pleas the horse was brought, the city and his wife plunged in sleep, the four mahādrājas and the Trāyastriṃśa gods appeared, Indra and Brahmā showed the way (v. 80) and the city-goddess's lament elicited the same vow (vv.82-93). In the Pāli jātaka Introduction the Bodhisattva looked at his wife and new-born son in the next room before mounting; deities, placing their palms under the hooves, muffled their sound, Channa followed, the deity of the city gate opened it and Māra's dissuasion proved in vain.
Departure scenes fall into two main groups, with frontal departure as above and with horse and rider in profile as on 1939.0119.16; the latter may be varied with a three-quarter view as on 1913.1108.2. Departures in profile go from right to left with a gateway behind the rider. A horizontal Departure cycle on a large scale has been proposed for a building not a stupa at Butkara I.
The frequently armoured figure, often with sword or bow, conducting the rider or pointing the way, either with hand held open or with wand or staff, has been identified as Māra who, in the Jātaka Introduction, attempts to halt the course to Enlightenment, Indra or Vaiśravaṇa; Foucher explains the other armed figures as the five hundred Śākya youths guarding each of the gates of Kapilavastu against the Bodhisattva's departure. The figure with a parasol, usually beside and behind the Bodhisattva, may be Chandaka; the figures emerging from the ground or complete above it and holding the horses' hooves to muffle them are yakṣas except where one or two female figures, identified as the earth-goddess, are recognised, Vajrapāṇi is first seen in this Bodhisattva's career on scenes of the Great Departure and the desponding female with mural crown often leaning her elbow on a post of moulded or architectural form is the nagaradevatā or city-goddess of Kapilavastu.

The haloed Bodhisattva sits touching the bodhimaṇḍa with his right hand from under the over-robe while his left holds high a loop of drapery and a gathered length from the robe below it which falls and spreads onto the seat; the drapery folds on his broad and full chest are shown as wide alternating grooves and ridges. His face is oval and full with the features harmoniously set into it. The branches above have clear pipal leaves and the face of the strewn seat has four panels, diagonally bisected to form triangles each containing an indented triangle, above a simple plinth, while the sides are plain.
On his left presumably Māra, wearing armour as on BM 1899.0609.19,34,68, a paridhāna, a crested turban, earrings and bracelets, prepares to draw his sword from a rectangular scabbard which hangs by a short, straight baldrick from his left shoulder. He is restrained or supported by a youthful figure with short hair beneath a chignon, who wears a collar and a necklace from his right shoulder over his left upper arm and a paridhāna and stands with one ankle across the other; he places one hand on Māra's shoulder and another over the baldrick. Beside them is another figure, with armour like Māra's but no paridhāna, holding a battle-axe below the head, its shaft resting on the ground; his left arm is damaged, and he has a segmented border of hair like ribbed beads. Above them, beside the tree, a horse's head and neck are turned towards the Bodhisattva; around the neck is a broad collar with bell-shaped pendant and the mouth spews flames. Alongside is a human monster with a double face, the upper face with hair, ears, eyes and nose while the moustached lower face has all the features from its hairline to the chin. He appears to have something twisted and in relief passing across his chest and perhaps connected with a damaged area beside him: it may be similar to the unexplained weapon held by a figure beside the tree opposite.
On the other side stands what seems to be the vanquished Māra, dressed as on the right but as if stealing away, both hands, with bracelets, over a sheathed sword, the baldrick coming from the waist and the suspension bridge visible. The scabbard appears to pass under the rolled bottom of the skirt and to be held between the knees. Māra is here apparently supported by the same figure as opposite but the paridhāna is shorter and the necklace runs over the opposite arm, while beside him stands an almost-naked bravo with a loincloth, and muscular legs, carved hourglass-fashion in contrast to the more columnar legs of the corresponding warrior on the opposite side. He has short hair and somewhat brutish features, and holds one damaged hand to the jutting chin while with the other he leans on a club resting on the ground. Above them is a partly animal-headed figure with rounded and protruding eyes and a long thin shaft across its chest beside the tree where the shaft seems to curve and join the foliage. Beside him a half-length horse-headed figure brings one paw or hand to its mouth while the other holds a sword.

Before the Enlightenment and under the bodhi tree the Bodhisattva was tempted by Māra with the pleasures of men, sovereignty and immortality as a god; when they had been rejected, Māra, disregarding the counsel of his son, returned 'in his great armour' with his army of 'frightful and monstrous beasts' who are described in great detail; creatures with such deformities may often be found on the sculpture. The Bodhisattva, after stroking his head and his bent knee, struck the ground thrice, the earth reverberated and Māra's army broke up, its animals stampeded, and the soldiers ran away and fell down in various ways. In the Pāli tradition the Jātaka Introduction also describes the discomfiture of a large army after Māra had mobilised different forces of nature in vain and the Earth had testified to the Bodhisattva's merit.
The above presentation of this theme was interpreted by Foucher, 1905-51: 1, 404-6, as showing Māra as assailant on the Bodhisattva's left and withdrawing discomfited on his right. For a simpler form see BM 1880.227. This presentation may also show Māra supported or, on the Bodhisattva's left, perhaps restrained by a figure that may be one of Māra's virtuous sons mentioned in texts as on this piece; Lahore 1281; Peshawar 128, 2070. The grotesque demons of Māra's army may be disposed as here and on Chandigarh 543 and Washington 49.9, and Māra's defeated soldiers may lie prostrate before the Bodhisattva's throne while Lahore 538, like Peshawar 2042, no doubt belonged to a more complex composition, with the latter showing Māra's three daughters and Māra himself seated at the side. Notwithstanding the textual presence of the earth goddess at this stage and what seems to be the earth-touching (bhūmisparśa) hand gesture invoking her as on this and the following piece, her appearance seems commoner on reliefs showing the events of BM 1895.1018.2. For an example of the present scene with the goddess see Berlin MIK I 10198, and for a fragment where the gesture above her appears to be the dhyānamudrā see Lahore 777 (Ingholt, 1957: 148, fig. 346).

In Mahāvastu II. 314-43, 405-12 certain sons of Māra are well affected towards the Bodhisattva. An even more detailed description of the horrors of Māra's army is in the Lalitavistara XXI, which also tells of those of his sons in it who were favourable to the Bodhisattva being on Māra's right while those hostile were on the left, how his assailants' weapons became flowers, how Māra tempted the Bodhisattva after the assault and the earth-goddess Sthavarā appeared in order to bear witness to the Bodhisattva's merits after he had struck the ground. In the Samghabhedavastu I.115 the earth-goddess makes her homage, the daughters of Māra appear and the army's assault follows their failure. The monsters of Māra's army are also briefly described in Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra (Lamotte, 1944-80: III, 1582) and more fully again in Buddhacarita XIII. In the Lalitavistara the temptation by Māra's daughters follows immediately and another, shorter account, in verse, of Māra's army occurs at the end of the chapter. A subsequent temptation by Māra's daughters is reported in Saṃyuttanikāya I.124 (Feer, 1932: 124-7, translated Rhys Davids, 1917: 156-9) and Lalitavistara XXIV.l.378-9 (translated Foucaux, 1884: 315), and see Lamotte, 1944-80: 11, 880 (fn. 1).
On Peshawar 2042 Mara appears to attack on the Bodhisattva's right and is attended by a different person on each side. On Berlin MIK I 10198 (Berlin, 1984: 70-1, no. 34) assailants appear on both sides and Indra in cylindrical cap and a figure in a lion's skin headdress seem to belong to the demonic army.

On the bottom only the top of a parasol and the pole of a canopy with some textile survive beneath the rounded rocky underside of the middle register. On the latter stand three female figures all facing the cave in varieties of three-quarter view, one with forearms broken, possibly once joined, one holding a covered dish or ball of flowers and the third, now headless, joining her hands. They each wear a long-sleeved tunic and over it a garment apparently draped over the left shoulder and covering the right foot and perhaps with a scarf also, a collar and, on the surviving heads, earrings and an indistinct ornament like a roll on top of the head with a looped string of beads in front of it and behind a long braid or headdress with transverse strips down the back. Seated on a ledge of the cave side, facing these figures but looking up, is a hairy monkey, its tail hanging down, aping the Buddha with legs crossed and hands in meditation. Above this register are more rounded ledges with long, pointed vegetation marks, here very flame-like, one large and in pronounced relief.
On the next register and beside the cave the lower part of a seated warrior with his right hand and a bracelet visible, his legs crossed at the ankles beside the remains of the shaft of a spear, wears a skirt of strips or plates; to his left and facing the cave are two now headless female figures like those below them but smaller, one with broken hands, the other carrying a ball of flowers. Beside the latter is a low pipal with a pair of feet from a lost figure on top.

Behind them are three half-length figures, one of whom, a haloed deity holding an opening lotus, wears a collar, bracelet and turban showing a crest with a central tapering ornament, while the other two show traces of a turban and a patterned collar. Opposite, a male with a short, densely and finely linear hairstyle, wearing a tunic and uttarīya, holds a censer or lamp as on BM 1945.0417.4, its flame pointed. He is followed by a woman, her straight hair parted and covered by a scarf, her hands joined; she perhaps wears a tunic under a garment draped over her left shoulder. Both garments have dense folds, more ridged, as though of thicker material, than those of the monks, but their simplicity suggests that the worshippers are lay followers of the Order. Of the three half-length figures above, one, haloed but with face lost, holds a flower; another with a collar is equally damaged; and a third, quite frontal, has thickly curled hair, earring(s) and a moustache.

The haloed Bodhisattva is seated on the bed, his hair in a chignon tied at its base and one leg pendent; he raises his right hand while his groom approaches carrying a turban. He wears a paridhāna and the uttarīya leaves the chest almost bare, except for a necklace with one pendant and a collar with pendants of various shapes. His wife is asleep on the bed with one hand under her head on the pillow, the arm grasped by the other hand; she is bare to the waist and wears multiple bracelets, a necklace, long earrings, a wreath of floral pattern and, under her lower garment, anklets.
At the right a female guard with spear, eyes closed in sleep, wears a long-sleeved tunic, a necklace and a semi-circular ornament above her forehead. Below, head buried in her arms which she supports on a banded barrel drum, a sleeping attendant with anklets, a long-sleeved tunic with a beaded strip down the side and over it a girdle with ornamental plates securing her paridhāna, part of which is drawn up between her legs into the girdle at the back, sits on a low circular cushion; she wears a densely segmented wreath headdress and a large loop of hair at the back of the head. Another attendant squats frontally, wreathed head supported on her arms and resting between her elbows on her knees. Her legs, spread wide under her garment, have large anklets. Another attendant, dressed like the first with a segmented wreath headdress but a very long braid and anklets, sits with her back to the viewer and supports herself on a large and flat cushion. The groom Chandaka, with a moustache, leans forward behind the couch and deferentially presents a crested turban with bands and the piriform frontal ornament, himself wearing a crested turban, uttarīya, paridhāna, necklace, earring and armlet in three lobes.
The couch consists of a mattress, pillows with a raised band on the side and a patterned textile with bands of open flowers, scrolling, crossed and hatched zones hanging between the hidden legs. A slender pillar behind supports an oil-lamp and across the back hangs a curtain.
The prominent double-framed flanking columns have a Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts, while the base mouldings, unusually, are of Attic type with a scotia.

Although this piece was conceived in a larger and less populated frame and carved with far less precision and delicacy than BM 1900.0414.12, the treatment of the sharply outlined, open eyes of the male figures, the closed eyes of the women, the shape of the heads and the flat execution of the faces are very similar.
The Bodhisattva's revulsion in the women's quarters before the Renunciation occurs in the more developed sources which describe the repellent dishevelled postures of the sleeping women musicians, the Bodhisattva's sense of a burial or cremation ground and his summoning Chandaka and Kaṇṭhaka. A similar tradition is in the Jātaka Introduction where 'the mother of Rāhula' and the child are in the next room.
The scenes of the Great Renunciation among the Women usually show the haloed Bodhisattva seated on a couch and turned to his right while a woman, presumably his wife, lies sleeping on it, head to the right, as women musicians sprawl below with their instruments. Chandaka enters from the left with the turban as here or with both horse and turban. The Bodhisattva is usually with his hair in a chignon, but on Peshawar 1718 he is standing and wears a turban in front of Chandaka and Kaṇṭhaka.

The garland running around the stupa may be seen as an offering with fertility imagery where the amorino is appropriately a yakṣa. The earlier garlanding of domes is illustrated at Bharhut and Sanci, where, as perhaps at Chatpat and Taxila, it was supported by pegs (compare BM 1892.1103.78, BM 1959.0717.1, BM 1949.0718.48 and BM 1904.1217.32).
The stone garland frieze, frequent on single narrow panels, both flat and curved, is not often found on the same slab as other horizontal registers. It occurs under a false gable arch, on stupa domes, on solid drums, on a fragment showing a double-domed roof, on a rectangular stupa platform, as an integral register below a preaching Buddha panel and below a row of Buddhas. The motif is found on stair-risers (BM 1880.883 and BM 1880.59) and on a panel reused beside the porch of a shrine at Butkara III.
The classical affinities of the continuous garland are referred generally to the eastern Mediterranean and a 2nd-century introduction. Combaz, with comparisons, proposes the garland frieze in Gandhāra as a classicising expression of a vegetal motif already present in the Indian tradition. The diffusion of the garland from Gandhāra may be seen at Kuṣāṇa Mathurā and, in the fifth century, in Kashmir.
For reliefs showing garlands on stupa domes, without amorini and perhaps to be thought of as hanging from pegs like BM 1892.1103.78, BM 1959.0717.1 and BM 1949.0718.48; see also BM 1902.1002.29 (with open flowers in the dips as at Butkara I).

On the right the hand of the lost standing Bodhisattva lays a long bundle of grass on the plain flat top of the bodhimaṇḍa. Behind it a figure rises almost in profile wearing uttarīya and with hair drawn back into a chignon secured with a fillet and a leaning tree trunk has branches with clearly pointed pipal leaves. Also beside the tree and standing frontally behind the seat another, slightly curving figure with similar hairstyle, collar, bracelets and uttarīya in the narrow mode raises his right hand as if in abhaya and with his left holds by the bottom of its scabbard a sword, the baldrick passing through the vertical suspension bridge and wound round the middle.
Left of the bodhimaṇḍa stand a male and female: the male is turbaned with a high crest to one side and wears a collar and necklace, earrings, armlets and bracelets, the uttarīya perhaps knotted and falling from the middle and in front of the paridhāna; the female stands with her left ankle over the right, wearing a wreath headdress with a loop of hair above, a beaded earring, necklace, a tunic and a long overgarment draped from her left arm, bracelets and anklets. Her stance emphasises the right hip on which she rests her hand while she leans with the other arm on the right shoulder of the male figure, throwing her head back; the drape over her right arm also emphasises the projecting hip and her necklace rounds one of her breasts. The male seems slightly to turn his head towards her as though distracted from his concern with the central event of the scene, and his mannered stance is emphasised by one hand on his necklace and the other on his hip. Above them are three haloed half-length figures turned towards the tree, all wearing uttarīya and chignon. Two have hands joined before them.

The accidental disposition of the break creates a dramatic contrast between the simplicity of the hand laying down the grass and the opulent softness, despite abrasion, in the modelling of the languorous-looking couple beside the bodhimaṇḍa; the broad, rounded planes of the male torso and the full, curved volumes of his face are of a piece with the woman's stance. Regardless of their identity, this contrast, highlighting renunciation, was perhaps not wholly accidental.
After receiving the homage of Kālika and Suvarṇaprabhāsā and considering the need to provide a grass seat for his Enlightenment as previous Buddhas had done, the Bodhisattva saw a grass-cutter called Svastika and asked him for grass; having spread the handful Svastika had given him at the foot of the bodhi tree, the Bodhisattva sat down upon it. In the Pāli tradition of the Jātaka Introduction the grass-cutter, called Sotthiya, gave eight bundles of grass and the Bodhisattva, after considering the cardinal points and facing the east, scattered the grass and a seat at once arose.
Foucher,  1905-51: I, 395ff, sees in the worshipping and emerging figure of Lahore 384 (ibid.: 1, fig. 199) a tree-spirit and refers us to four male or eight female spirits (devatās) of the bodhi tree in the Lalitavistara; the four almost identical male figures, three haloed, on this panel may be such a set; the figure with sword may then be an attendant on Māra (if not Māra himself according to Majumdar), who, with one of his daughters, already stands beside the maṇḍa preparing for the Temptation [see Foucher, 1905-51: II, I95-7 withdrawing his suggestion (ibid.: I, 396) that the couple is the nāga Kālika with consort]. For Māra beside the bodhi tree on the middle architrave on the North Gateway of Sāncī I see Marshall and Foucher, 1940: II, pl. XXIX. 
For a close parallel for the two figures beside the bodhimaṇḍa compare the bottom scene of a false gable slab where the tall Bodhisattva is accompanied by Vajrapāṇi only and a celestial throwing flowers; Majumdar considers the worshipper rising from the strewn seat of this relief to be the grass-cutter Svastika and the figure holding the sword in the same way as here, Māra. The bodhimaṇḍa has the same floral ornament and the grass is laid down on a top already strewn. For variants of this scene but all with the Bodhisattva laying down grass see Calcutta G. 18/A23272 (Majumdar, 1937; 45, no. 46 and pl.

The textile hanging from the table has vertical rows of blown flowers, scrolling, diagonally bisected squares, heart-shapes, beaded and hatched bands; the turned corners show similar vertical rows behind, and at the corners are bushy tassels. This attention to textile design, often in marked relief, has already been noted, with references, as a feature of carving from Swat valley sites such as Butkara I.2.

The distribution of the relics falls into a shorter cycle within the Death cycle and presupposes them to have been claimed with threats of hostilities by eight parties who agreed to submit themselves to the arbitration of a brāhmaṇa. He is usually behind a table, which can be small or large, standing in the middle or to one side, the latter usually when the table is small and few claimants are shown, but he can be central with a small table and few claimants or central with a large table and a row of claimants flanking him. The claimants sometimes hold reliquaries, while on the table may be relics made into balls (according to Foucher their size is one droṇa) or caskets, as above. They can number the full eight or fewer; the balls are often cross-hatched or suggest grape bunches or blackberries. In this form they may represent the clay balls into which Hindu remains are still embedded for the asthikṣepa ceremony, but an enveloping mesh or floral garland seems also possible. The presence of guards is common to other scenes of the Distribution and may reflect the threat of hostilities over the relics.; Zwalf 1985

The Bodhisattva's damaged forearms originally met in dhyāna; he is naked to the waist where a twisted roll of textile forms a girdle; the upper garment is distinguishable only as a narrow strip wound above each elbow and falling to the side. Below the waist he is covered with very summary indications of a garment, but the soles seem bare. His head, unevenly sliced at right angles to the slab, is bearded on one side along the jaw to the chin and still has one deep-set eye, a prominent cheek-bone and horizontal mouth below a moustache. The hair is drawn back from a sharp hairline into the uṣṇīṣa. The very large halo, but for an inner groove defining a border, is plain. The flat-shouldered torso is ribbed, the top of the rib cage plunging in a deep 'V' below the protruding vertebrae. Nippled breasts project slightly and the waist is indrawn at the navel. The posture is dramatically straight and still, the arms bony. The face of the grass-covered rectangular seat has triangular panels each containing a large, roughly triangular indentation.
To his right stands a bearded, hirsute and lean-faced Vajrapāṇi who holds below his right shoulder a vajra that is almost a long baton; he has both shoulders covered by a long garment and at the broad flat girdle he is in very low relief. In higher relief beside him is a full-faced woman wearing a long tunic falling about her feet and a long overgarment draped over her left shoulder, her sleeves of thick material, her joined hands containing perhaps a floral offering or garland. She wears hoop earrings, a collar and hair coiled at the back of the head and resembling a wreath. Opposite, a standing male figure, corresponding to Vajrapāṇi but turning sideways, wears Indra's headdress with a moulded cylindrical top, earrings, collar and uttarīya; he holds flowers in both hands. Beside him a male figure wearing a sleeved tunic and an uttarīya, earrings and collar, joins his hands with an offering also.

During these practices gods reported his imminent death to the Bodhisattva's mother in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, but when she came she was consoled that he would attain nirvāṇa; she left him to continue his practices but his father sent daily messengers to learn of his son's condition and the gods watched day and night and worshipped him. Now the Bodhisattva decided that asceticism did not lead to salvation and resolved to take food again. The gods offered to feed him through the pores of his hair but he refused and preferred either to prepare his own food, supplemented with milk-rice from Sujātā, a village headman's daughter, or to take it from her entirely. The Pāli tradition is, in canonical accounts, substantially similar as to the ascetic practices, but the story of Sujātā and her food offering to the Bodhisattva as he sat under a 'nyagrodha' is in the commentatorial literature and refers to the eve of the Enlightenment when the Bodhisattva had already begged food, broken his fast and resumed his former appearance.
Apparently evolved in and at first confined to Gandhāra, figures of the fasting Bodhisattva, whether large, as at Lahore and Peshawar, or that from Shotorak and smaller pieces, may have been meditational images besides serving narrative purposes, perhaps with separate flanking figures. Relief panels with flanking figures are not especially numerous and also differ among themselves too much to provide dependable explanations for this piece. Examples with female assistants are inconclusive and male assistants range from donors to deities.
For quite exceptional sequences of very unusual aspect see Berlin MIK 1 79,14 where, from right to left, the emaciated Bodhisattva is flanked by Brahmā and Indra and crosses the Nairañjanā and, quite restored, receives bowls from flanking females; and a strip, in a private Japanese collection, where the skeletal Bodhisattva is flanked by tormenting village children, then by women offering a bowl and water pot respectively and, finally, in his normal appearance, receives a bundle of grass.
While it seems certain that the Bodhisattva is here attended by Vajrapāṇi and Indra, the flanking and formally paired male and female worshippers seem like donors and may be intentionally ambiguous. Foucher prefers to see in the outer male worshipper Brahmā with a collar (see BM 1917.0501.1) beside Indra, while the corresponding female, if not Māyā come from the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, then Sujātā offering food.
For a Western affinity for the fasting Bodhisattva seen by Rowland in the brutal realism of the Hellenistic art of Alexandria, compare Lamb, 1929: pl. LXXVIIa.; Zwalf 1985
Disappointed by spiritual masters, the Bodhisattva took to severe fasting and was even reported dead. When fasts failed to reveal the truth, he turned to the middle way between worldliness and mortification, one definition of the Buddhist path to salvation. He accepted a rice-brew from a village headman's daughter, who had come to offer it to a nature spirit in thanksgiving for the birth of a son. She stands beside the emaciated Bodhisattva with his frequent companions, the gods Indra and Brahmā, and his protector Vajrapāṇi.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The haloed Bodhisattva wears an uttarīya over both shoulders; one end passes under his right arm while the other lies over the left elbow, leaving the chest bare. A pleated end of the paridhāna falls onto the rectangular seat between the knees. On the turban bands meet at a large central bead beneath a fantail crest with pointed conical ornament and a summarily executed vertical loop of cloth with an end below projects at both sides. The Bodhisattva wears a collar and necklace, both plain, earrings and bracelets. His head is oval and regular, the face slightly fleshy with protruding rounded eyes, the edges above them for eyebrows and the curved mouth sharp. The torso is broad and spreading with raised breasts beside the necklace and a globular navel. Above him branches with large, more or less paired leaves curve upwards.
On the Bodhisattva's left a turbaned kneeling figure wears uttarīya and paridhāna and joins his hands as if to leave a space between them. He may be Indra. His turban and ornaments are like those of the Bodhisattva. Opposite a figure kneels similarly and in similar dress, but with collar only and long hair beneath a horizontal length of hair, knotted in the middle and looped at one end; the joined hands are damaged. The face, with protruding rounded eyes like those on the other figures, is fuller and fleshier and if the figure is Brahmā the collar is exceptional.

If the presence of Brahmā, notwithstanding the rare collar, is admitted together with that of Indra, this scene may illustrate the Instigation (saṃcodana) in which these and other gods urge the Bodhisattva to renounce the world (see also BM 1890.1116.1). Commenting on the rather loose iconography for this subject, Foucher, 1905-51: 11, 222, refers to instances showing a turbaned and meditating figure under branches which he explains as contamination from outdoor scenes. If instead this scene illustrates the Bodhisattva Śvetaketu in the Tuṣita heaven considering his last birth as Siddhārtha, it has some agreements with the well-known relief from Sikri ascribed to this theme, and there is literary support for the presence of Brahmā and Indra. Lobo, proposing another iconograhy for the Tuṣita scenes, has identified the Sikri panel as showing the Bodhisatva's meditations before the earthly Instigation, and in another, where a turbaned Bodhisattva in dhyāna is shown as here together with Brahmā and Indra, she believes the meditations are combined with the Instigation itself.

The standing Megha raises his damaged right hand holding flowers, his left holds a broken water pot at his waist; he wears an ascetic's tunic with bared right shoulder and his hair is gathered into a chignon. Megha reappears below in a curved posture on hands and knees, hair perhaps extending below Dlpamkara's feet. An oblique doorway behind, with moulded sloping jambs, a rectangular threshold and an indistinct lintel, frame Prakṛti who holds a pot at her waist.

Behind him are two monks in rhythmically curved stance, their right arms in the robe across the chest and the left hanging down with a curved gathering of drapery to the bottom of the garment.
In the next scene, in the centre, a turbaned and haloed figure with uttarīya and paridhāna, and showing a muscular chest and arm, stands with one arm down, the other on the hip, wearing the usual ornaments. Beside him his queen is seated on a long draped seat, her raised right hand holding a lotus; she wears a wreath headdress with protruding loop of hair and ornaments.

From right to left a youthful haloed deity with moustache and a chignon bound at the base stands almost in profile with his right hand raised, palm outward. He wears a paridhāna and uttarīya, a collar with small pendants and double bracelets, that on his left wrist beaded and with discs. Beside him Indra, slightly turned towards the king, raises his right hand at right angles to himself, the thumb across the palm, a flat vajra in the left hand and wearing paridhāna and uttarīya in the narrow mode. He is crowned with his cylindrical cap, its side cross-hatched and with mouldings above, which rests on a wreath or a rounded ornamental brim, and wears one wide flat bracelet and another like that of the deity beside him, a collar and a necklace. Between him and the group around Śibi an almost frontal figure, turned slightly towards the king and with a small double-looped chignon on a bowl crop hairstyle, earrings, moustache, paridhāna and uttarīya, holds a weighing device of steelyard type consisting of a suspended bar also supported by a damaged hand. At one end what must be the king's flesh is heaped in a suspended bag, its weight measured along the other, longer side of the bar. Above is a damaged projection discussed below.
At the left the drooping king is seated on a throne, supporting himself over one side at the right armpit while with his other arm he clasps the woman in front of him, his hand on her back. The footstool, adorned with three open flowers, emphasises a large foot and the bared leg, thrust forward, from which a kneeling figure with moustache, paridhāna, uttarīya and earrings, cuts with a knife. The king has a moustache, wears a crested turban, a collar with large circular pendants and a necklace, armlets, bracelets, earrings, paridhāna and uttarīya. The woman in front of him, with wreath headdress and necklace, long-sleeved garment, a scarf or long garment draped over her left shoulder and braid on the back, leans forward, stretching out her left hand to the king's side. Above the king is a parasol decorated with a trellised motif; the throne, with back and sides, has a textile draped over the side beneath the king's arm, a floral panel and an elaborate turned leg beside which stands the pigeon.
On all the figures drapery folds are shown by dense grooves and ridges, heads are well shaped, round to oval and the features clear-cut with open eyes and distinct upper lids. The torsos are generally smooth with gentle modelling, nipples and gashed navels on the males. The heavy lids give a certain uniformity of appearance and this suggests a sad and solemn participation of all the protagonists. The king's forehead is puckered in pain and the angle of his head, like that of the other actors, and the forward posture of the woman, whose supporting arm is undercut, emphasise the pathos of the event. The composition balances the group of tall deities observing, Indra now in his true form at the climax of the sacrifice, the central figure of the weigher in a gentle compassionate dehanchement, holding the suspended flesh in emphatic relief, and the heads of the king, the woman and the wiclder of the knife aligned in a triangular scheme.
The broken projection above the figure with the steelyard must be the hawk or falcon; we appear to have continuous narration, with Indra and his earlier form as bird and correspondingly the youthful figure on the right may be the divine Viśvakarmā along with his form as the pigeon.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 5.50 centimetres; Height: 23.30 centimetres; Width: 32.40 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The theme, to be distinguished from Śibi's gift of his eyes (also commemorated on one of the 'four great stupas'), occurs, with variants, in different texts and tells how Indra tested the resolve of the Bodhisattva in his birth as King Śibi. Śibi, who had vowed to protect all creatures, ransomed a pigeon pursued by Indra disguised as a falcon, eagle, or sparrow-hawk, while the pigeon was really the god Viśvakarmā acting at Indra's behest. Śibi offered in his own flesh the equivalent of the pigeon's weight; parts of his body were successively cut off and heaped into a scale, but the pigeon proved still too heavy until the king, with what was left of himself, got into it. In this extremity he reaffirmed his joy at fulfilling the Bodhisattva vow and prayed, in token of his sincerity, to become whole again; and this then came about. The two gods resumed their own forms.
The execution recalls the so-called Buner group; the drapery the 'drawing' manner of Butkara I; Viśvakarmā/Brahmā's necklace that of a spectator on Peshawar 2071 (Ingholt, 1957: fig. 16); and compare Fabregues.

From Whitfield 1985:
This seated figure, entirely flat at the back, was made in a mould as an appliqué piece. It was one of the Buddha figures in the nimbus of a colossal standing figure of the Buddha, of which only the lower legs and drapery were still extant when Stein examined and photographed the site (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XIVb). The oval head, which has lost the facial features, echoes the treatment seen in the large head (Pl. 63). The regular drapery folds are for the most part simple incised lines, hugging the form beneath and following the general conventions of Gandharan sculpture. Due to early consolidation work, the surface of the figure has acquired a shine which differs from the matt appearance of the original red clay wash.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此佛坐像的背面完全是平的，是用模子製作的化佛。化佛是安裝在巨大佛立像的頭光上的，當斯坦因考查此遺迹進行拍照時，那巨像的腳尖和衣紋還殘留著（參照《古代和田》圖版XIV.b）。頭部爲橢圓形，面部已經破損，其色彩大概與圖63的佛頭相同。另外，衣紋線基本是用簡單而有規則的刻線表現，衣服下的線條很有肉感，大概融合了犍陀羅雕刻的流派。由於早期的固化作用，像的表面出現一層光澤，這與紅粘土製品表面沒有光澤是不同的。","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts",Not on display,,,buddha; 佛 (Chinese),Representation of: Buddha;  Representation of: 佛陀,,,,,,,,1907,"The 1907-11-11 group refers to objects from Stein's First Central Asian  Expedition, 1900-01.

From Whitfield 1985:
Miniature plaques such as these were produced in quantity by the use of moulds, and applied to form parts of the nimbus decoration of larger statues. In the case of many of the Rawak figures, this decoration was quite elaborate (see Gropp, 1974, Fig. 110, p. 233), and they appear around the edges of the aureoles of standing figures as well as in the nimbus (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XVIIIc). As Stein himself wrote:
Special artistic interest attaches to the remains of the elaborate aureoles which ... encircled these statues. They varied but little in details. Every-where there was a border formed by a cloud-scroll, and within it a broad band showing small plaques of seated Buddhas or Bodhisattvas inserted between wreaths of a very graceful bead-ornament. The latter were gathered at intervals into bunches surmounted y a fleur-de-lis. A second band of small seated Buddhas seems to have filled the space left between the highly ornamental border and the edges of the drapery. (Ibid., Vol. I, p.499)
The plaque from Dandan-oilik, probably somewhat later than that from Rawak, had a similar purpose: it bears traces of pigment as follows: “hair black, robe brown, seat pink, inner part of vesica pink, outer ray emerald green. The whole appears to have been on background of indigo” (ibid., Vol. I, p.289).; Chinese

He decided to create a set on the ten great disciples of Shaka (the historical Buddha) after seeing a sculpture of Subodai, the subject of this print, which belonged to the Kofukuji Temple, Kyoto, and which was on display in the Imperial Museum in Tokyo (now the Tokyo National Museum). According to his own account in 'Hanga no michi' ('The Way of Prints', 1956), he came across some suitable large woodblocks which he carved quickly without even using drawings, compressing the extremes of the bodies into the edges of the blocks as if they were bursting out of them spontaneously. The set was made to put on to a pair of sixfold screens, as it was the artist's custom to design his works for traditional painting formats. Each subject was thus conceived for a specific place on the screen, and the variety of stances in the set is fully understandable only in that light. As ten subjects looked unbalanced, he enclosed them each end (with typical lack of regard for canonical correctness) with two extra subjects, the Bodhisattvas Fugen and Monju. The title of the series is sometimes, therefore, quoted as 'Two Bodhisattvas and the Ten Great Followers of Shaka'. The disciples themselves are all shown as Buddhist monks, more or less in Japanese folk style, but retaining some of the Indian characteristics they were by tradition given. Subodai was the disciple said to have the greatest understanding of the doctrine of the void, or nothingness.
Most of Munakata's blocks were destroyed with his house in an air raid on Tokyo on 25 May 1945, but those for the 'Ten Disciples' survived because he had used them to shore up his air-raid shelter. He was thus able to take new pulls as demand increased, especially after his standing in the world rose after his 1955 success at the São Paolo Biennale. This example is presumed to be after January 1962, when Munakata received the Buddhist title of 'hogen' (Eye of the Law), which is incorporated in the seal, though it is possible he proudly added the new seal to an older pull.",Smith 1983 / The Japanese Print Since 1900: Old dreams and new visions; Smith 1994 / Modern Japanese Prints 1912-1989: Woodblocks and Stencils,Not on display,,,religion/belief,Representation of: Subhūti,,,,Purchased from: Robert G Sawers,,,,1981,,,Asia,,"1981,0331,0.2",,,,,1981033102

The great Buddhist stūpa at Amarāvatī was one of the most important centres of Buddhism in southern India from the early centuries of the present era until its complete abandonment some time after the fourteenth century. This pre-eminence was initially based on the economic power of the Sātavāhana kings who are closely associated with the city of Dharaṇīkoṭa, close to the stūpa. During the Sātavāhana period, the city no doubt provided a ready source of patronage, a situation only changed by the rise of the Ikṣvāku dynasty based at Nāgārjunakoṇḍa further up the river Krishna.
In the manner of early Buddhist stūpa, the whole structure was surrounded by a railing fence of which the present example is a part. The railing, vedikā, was made up of upright elements (such as this) and cross-bars which connected these standing, horizontal parts. The outer faces of the uprights were decorated with lotus blossoms and small figural scenes -including those showing gaṇas playing music and dancing. The inner face, as seen here, was the face which would have been seen by devotees performing pradakṣiṇā; this was conceived rather differently. Here scenes from the life of the Buddha and from the jātakas were shown, as moral precepts to be 'read' by those who processed around the stūpa.
Of great interest in the roundel is the symbolic indication of the presence of the holy child, by footprints on the cloth held by the old man in the centre of the roundel. There is no bodily image shown. This relief belongs to that earlier period at Amaravati when the bodily form is still only shown symbolically; during the next century this was to change with profound consequences not only in the Indian subcontinent, but throughout Southeast Asia and the Far East.","Tripe 1859 / Photographs of the Elliot Marbles and other subjects in the Central Museum, Madras; Fergusson 1873 / Tree and Serpent Worship; Barrett 1954 / Sculptures from Amaravati in the British Museum; Morley 1985 / Indian Sculpture; Knox 1992 / Amaravati: Buddhist sculpture from the Great Stupa; Blurton 1997 / The Enduring Image: Treasures from the British Museum",Not on display,"Exhibited:

The Buddha stands frontally in slight 'dehanchement', but his left leg is flexed and its foot raised, while his right leg points sideways as if he is walking. His right hand is raised, palm outwards, to the centre of his breast in a less usual, perhaps archaic abhayamudra, while the left hand rests somewhat indistinguishably at the hip, not very clearly holding the robe which seems also to be wrapped round the wrist and falling from it; a length of the robe also appears to hang from the right arm. The neckline on Buddha A is coherently in relief, while on Buddha B it is more diffused and linear; Buddha A is generally more finely executed, a thinner and taller figure with a long oval face and a more pronounced peak of the undulating hair where the face of the other is rounder, more youthful and with a less clear moustache. On both the robe hangs with some effect of wet drapery. Both Buddhas are haloed, but on Buddha A the halo has a raised border and the uṣṇīṣa is much larger and, with the open eyes and moustache, recalls an early Buddha type in stone.
On each Buddha's left stands a haloed turbaned figure of Indra in profile, his head somewhat inclined, the left leg flexed a little backwards, the left arm, with a bracelet and armlet, raised and hand(s) joined. He wears a paridhāna, and unusually the uttarīya hangs front and back over his right shoulder and loops round the left waist; on figure A a short length also hangs over the left shoulder. Other differences are in the position and relief of the lower left leg and in the more abundant drapery of the uttarīya on figure B.
On each Buddha's right a haloed and bearded figure of Brahmā, with a large chignon and a water pot held in his left hand, walks towards the Buddha and raises his right hand no higher than the Buddha's; it is seen from the back with the fingers curved forwards. He wears a paridhāna, and the uttarīya over his left shoulder, with a long fluttering fall at his back, appears on the left arm and loops in the narrow mode round the right of the body. Differences between the two are the finer tooling and relief of the taller and erect figure of group A, while that of B seems more squat and has a more bowed posture; both make a distinctly classicising impression.
The haloed dividing figure is youthful and stands frontally, his flexed left leg and his right foot recalling the Buddha's stance; his hands are brought together before his breast and he wears a paridhāna and uttarīya with two long ends falling on each side; the uttarīya crosses the body in the narrow mode from the left shoulder where it also forms a horizontal semiloop. Both arms wear an armlet and bracelets. The hair is in a chignon drawn in at its base; below it falls from a parting to form pronounced 'bouffant' locks at the sides, especially on the figure behind the Indra of group B, whose expression is much more of a beatific smile. Like that of Buddha A, his halo shows a raised border. Figure A, standing behind Indra A, also appears taller and in greater and clearer relief and his expression seems more austere. Huntington holds these figures to be a Bodhisattva (1985, p.115), while Cribb has discussed them as perhaps Maitreya (1985, pp.82-3).~Above and below the arcade is a row of garnets in gypsy settings separated by a motif of four petals or lobes, some more like pairs of linked heart shapes. In the spandrels are distinct and well-articulated eagles soaring with outspread wings and heads turned to each other to form pairs, their feathers carefully indicated by shallow grooves and punched dots. At the bottom of the casket are mouldings as of a pillar base with a plinth and a rather small torus under a large cavetto. On the underside is a blown lotus of eight double-outlined and centrally grooved petals narrowing towards the gynoecium, which is punched with large dots; between the petals and the border is a field densely punched with smaller dots, and between the points of the petals are small, standing, opening lotuses in the fashion seen on 1899,0609.39 (Zwalf 1996).",,,,,,,Buddhist,1stC (circa),Made in: Darunta,Excavated/Findspot: Bimaran Stupa 2,gold; garnet; pitch,,,repoussé; inlaid,Diameter: 6.60 centimetres at base ; Diameter: 6 centimetres at rim ; Height: 6.50 centimetres,,"This reliquary was found inside the inscribed steatite reliquary 1880.27.

Framed by arcades formed with the Indian pointed arch are the Buddha and the gods Indra and Brahmā shown twice and separated by a worshipper whose head-dress, ear-rings and armlets suggest a Bodhisattva. Between the arches are eagles and, above and below, garnets. The inscription refers to relics of the Buddha dedicated by one Śivarakṣita; if the coins found nearby were contemporary, the reliquary would be of the 1st century AD and its Buddha image perhaps earlier than Kaniṣka I's reign. The resemblance of the Buddhas on this casket and Kaniṣka I's gold coin (no.121) appears close.","Masson Uncat. MSS; Masson MSS Eur. E161/VII; Wilson 1841 / Ariana Antiqua.

The characters are now picked out in white and are of smaller size along the shoulder than those in the shorter line below it.

The coins are identifiable from Masson's description of 'Indo-Scythic' coins and account of the finds in Wilson 1841, p.118 as Kushan coins of Wima Kadphises, Kanishka I and Huvishka, i.e. a similar combination of the same types as the 21 coins from Chahar Bagh Stupa 4 (see CM 1979,0215.21-41).

In Gandhāra the vedikā of structural stupas has hardly survived in situ. Stupas with a vedikā pierced by a gateway and with a stair are found among the petroglyphs at Chilas II.
According to a manuscript note by Major Pearse found at the Museum inside BM 1887.0717.30 and now in the archive of the Department of Oriental Antiquities, this model was 'procured in March 1851 from a topie or mound at the village of Jowalean on the Hurroo River in the District of Huzaree, Punjab'. Cunningham, 1871: 147, attributes this model to stupa C opened by Major Pearse in March 1851 and supposes it still to have carried some of its original gilding to account for recollections reported to him of a golden figure.

The Bodhisattva, born as the ever-charitable Viśvaṃtara, gave away to brāhmaṇas the auspicious white elephant on which he rode and was on this account banished with his wife Madrī and their two children. On the road he gave away his chariot and horses and the parents continued on foot, each carrying a child, to a hermitage; there, in Madrī's absence, he gave away his children to be servants of a brāhmaṇa. When Madrī returned she was given to Indra, disguised as a brāhmaṇa, for the Bodhisattva's final test. The god then resumed his shape, restored Madrī and, by his intervention, the children were redeemed from the brāhmaṇa by their grandfather. In the much longer Pāli account the protagonists have almost the same names, and despite many differences of detail the sequence of events is the same.

An arrow protrudes from his chest and two animals, probably goats, look back in the direction from which it came. A third, larger animal, probably a goat and perhaps also in a state of arrest, faces him in front of a tree. Next Śyāma falls or lies, raising a leg and arm, beneath another tree, observed from the rocks by another goat, kneeling.

In the Mahāvastu account the Bodhisattva became incarnated as Śyāma(ka), to serve, as their only son, a frail and blind pair of ascetics. While fetching them water he fell victim to the arrow of a king hunting a deer and, as he died, entrusted his parents to the penitent king's care. Amid the lamentations of animal creation the king brought the old couple water and the tidings of their son's death and led them back to where he lay. As his mother cradled his head, his father invoked his son's merits and by that incantation restored him to life. For the role of Indra in this connection see 1880-55. The Pāli tradition has a somewhat different frame-story in which the king, when hunting, deliberately shot Sāma ( = Śyāma), because he realised that he was an exceptional being and wished to prevent his escape until he had learned who he was. The story ends in the same way but both parents caress their dead child, both invoke his merits and their sight is restored with his life.

In the Pali tradition of jātaka 485 the armed king of Benares comes upon a kiṃnara couple playing and dancing beside a stream; enamoured of the kiṃnarī, the king shoots the kiṃnara, who is the Bodhisattva, but his consort refuses the king and calls upon the gods. Indra, moved by her fidelity and disguised as a brāhmaṇa, sprinkles the Bodhisattva with water and restores him to life.
The identification of this theme in Gandhāra is due to Foucher following Vogel; a Sanskrit story of the faithful kiṃnarī lacks the playing and dancing and in it the widowed sprite shares her consort's funeral pyre. Whatever the subject, on the only other comparable piece reported the archer is on foot and aims at a couple also with a male harpist; the next scene shows the male musician lying dead while the archer in two successive incidents is perhaps trying to take a grieving woman away. The scene at Bhārhut captioned 'Kinara jātaka' lacks any sufficient feature in common with the Gandhāra pieces and Luiders, 1963: I36ff., refers it to another story.

The damaged horizontal framing elements are those of BM 1880.54. Foucher, 1917a: 271-81, quotes two Chinese texts ['Aśvaghoṣa Sūtrālaṃkāra' (French translation in Huber, 1908: 321-30) and 'Jing lu yi xiang' (Nanjio 1329 = Taisho IV.203), translated in Chavannes, 1910-34: III, 210-11 (no. 440)] which tell how a bird (a parrot in the 'Jing lu yi xiang' and a goose in 'Aśvaghoṣa')  swallowed a valuable pearl while a monk on his begging round was in a jeweller's shop and its owner was absent fetching him food. Rather than reveal this and cause the bird's death, the monk, while denying his own guilt, preferred to be unjustly accused and beaten by the jeweller until the blood ran. The bird attempted to drink it and was accidentally killed by the blows. The monk then became free to speak, the bird was cut open and the pearl found inside it. In pointing out that this relief is exceptional in representing a theme not connected with the Buddha, Foucher wonders whether, in the version known to the Gandhāra sculptor, the monk might have been one of his particular companions and only very hesitantly connects it with Lahore 119, a fragment showing a monk tied to a post or pillory. Foucher, 1917a: 274, also identifies the first figure as thejeweller by his Roman type of steelyard, but it is not distinguishable in the now damaged feature which even in the early photograph was very abraded and seems only the outstretched hand(s) of the person offering. The activity at the table in Foucher's view is thejeweller's search for the gem swallowed by the bird. Foucher, ibid.: 273, actually believes that the bird is drinking the monk's blood. The supposed Indra lacks headdress, bracelets and necklace. Consequently, Foucher admits that this interpretation is weak.

According to the summary List of sculptures from Yusufzai (Cunningham, infra) supplemented by an old photograph, this length, together with 1880.32 on the left, formed the sixth riser on the stair to the main stupa at Jamalgarhi.
It was Foucher who proposed to see in this length part of the Maitrakanyaka jātaka; the hull then represents the ship still intact on the voyage, and on the damaged part between it and the shore Maitrakanyaka struggles landwards on his plank after the shipwreck. The rest of the riser then shows his successive reception by two and four apsarases in front of their respective towns. The other representations of this jātaka show the end of the story: on one short length Maitrakanyaka is received before a door and makes music with a woman before meeting the victim of the wheel, but the other may belong to a series of fragments on which Maitrakanyaka rides a horse at the head of a caravan. The present length is incomplete; 1880.32, its admittedly damaged neighbour on riser 6 according to the photographic record, hardly suggests its continuation, but 1880.43 may have belonged although it cannot have been immediately adjacent. If this is the Mahājanaka jātaka, as was once supposed in the Museum, only the beginning of this length could illustrate the king's son's shipwreck and, doubtfully, his reaching Mithilā, and there is again no obvious connection with the rest of the length or its neighbour 1880.32 .
The Bodhisattva as Maitrakanyaka was a sea-faring merchant's only son who took up his late father's dangerous livelihood; as she clasped his feet to dissuade him, he kicked his mother's head. Shipwrecked on his first voyage, he reached land on a plank and was successively received and entertained in four cities: in the first by four, in the second by eight, in the third by sixteen and in the fourth by thirty-two apsarases. Having escaped their attentions, he reached a city of iron in which a man was undergoing torment as a flaming metal wheel revolved upon his head, the blood, marrow and chyle from it forming his only sustenance. As this was in punishment for disrespect to a mother, the wheel at once came to rest on the Bodhisattva's head and would have long so continued until another, similarly guilty, should come, but the Bodhisattva's readiness to save others by enduring the torment for ever earned him its instant cessation. In the Pāli tradition a merchant's son, Mittavindaka, was cast adrift on a raft to save the ship and met on successive islands female spirits of the dead in numbers increasing by the same geometrical progression before encountering a man with a sharp wheel on his head and taking it on his own. But Mittavindaka was not the Bodhisattva and he was obliged to expiate to the end.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, chipped and worn.

A number of examples combine the three elements of this piece, the Buddha, a disc on a pedestal and monks, which could stand for the Three Jewels of Buddhism, the Buddha, the Doctrine and the Order. In most instances the disc is, as here, floral or floral with the characteristics of a wheel, but a plain disc with a border of radiate petals is found on a piece now in private hands. Save for here, the Buddha always appears to touch or turn the disc. The combination of these three elements also occurs on a harmikā (San Francisco B60 SI) in succession to the Birth, the Great Departure and Entreaty to Preach and this suggests that the iconography may have served as a variant representation of the First Sermon, especially as one of apparently five monks is carrying a seat of the type discussed in BM 1940.0713.4, where other examples which suggest the same continuous narration are listed. In other instances, like the present, where the cloth may be an offering, no seat is brought. Deer in this connection, as against examples with the three wheels (compare BM 1970.0602.1), appear never to be present.
A disc, lacking any floral aspect and seen as a solar symbol of the Buddha (see BM 1966.1017.2), can occur with what seem to be the knees of the Buddha's crossed legs behind it, perhaps confirming an innovating iconography. In the present case the common overlap between the wheel shown as such and floral discs (compare Foucher, 1905-51: I, 429) may indicate that the Doctrine is indeed to be understood here and that the identity of the Buddha with the Doctrine (Benisti, 1977: 65-6) is further emphasised by the appearance, so far isolated in the present iconography, of his crossed legs behind it while the flanking Buddha in the exceptional abhaya gesture may be in an expository or legitimating role as he is perhaps also, but with a different gesture, on BM 1902.1002.26.

Māyā, with the left leg across the right at the ankles, wears a draped garment from the left shoulder, a paridhāna round it, a scarf which passes behind the back and hangs from both upper arms, a cross-hatched wreath headdress on top of the head, earrings, bracelets, a collar and anklets. The haloed infant in high relief, with uṣṇīṣa, and both arms undercut as they rest on the swaddling cloth, emerges almost to the legs from her right side. Māyā's attendant, who has been identified with Mahāprajāpatī, her sister, wears a sleeved tunic over a paridhāna, a twisted and rounded circular headdress, perhaps of cloth, and the same ornaments and stands slightly inclined, one leg crossing the other below the knees. Another female figure behind her, dressed like Māyā but with a segmented wreath or diadem, brings her right hand to her mouth in astonishment while the left hand holds a cross-hatched palm branch. Indra, opposite, bends forward with an unusually long swaddling cloth above his flexed left leg. His uttarīya is in the wide mode and he wears a collar, earrings and a cylindrical cap with a motif of squares with crossed diagonal lines. All the figures have long oval faces and sharply cut features with rounded protruding eyes. Above them are branches, spreading in the centre and at each side, the leaves symmetrically paired.
The panel is flanked by somewhat broad framing pilasters with sharply cut Corinthian capitals in distinct upper and lower parts, a recessed oblong panel with curved ends top and bottom on each shaft and the usual base mouldings. The centre line is continued vertically in the middle of the framing border below.
In the clockwise direction of worship this face is followed by those described in  1880.227, 1880.227 and 1880.227.

The oval head has sharply cut features and beyond the sharp hairline wavy hair continues into the uṣṇīṣa. The branches above bear clear pipal leaves. The strewn seat has a moulded plinth, plain sides and, on the face, the same motif as on BM 1895.1018.2. On the Bodhisattva's left Māra is about to draw his sword from the scabbard; he wears a paridhāna and a twisted scarf or uttarīya over his left shoulder, a turban with a knot or crest over his left ear, a collar, earrings, armlets and bracelets. Above him is a half-length figure with tousled hair, a grim expression, a sleeved and quilted shirt and perhaps a shield over his left shoulder. On the right is presumably Māra again, the turban knot, since it here appears over the other ear, perhaps intended for the back, and he appears to be stealing away, his hands held before him; his sheathed sword, now between the knees, hangs by a baldrick running from behind the back and though a suspension bridge on the scabbard. Above, another half-length armed figure wears a helmet with a curved brim rising to a point above the forehead.
The third face of a stupa base or harmikā block shows the Entreaty to Preach the Doctrine. The haloed Buddha, hands in dhyāna and covered in the over-robe, wears this garment over both shoulders; the curved neckline is in relief and the grooves for drapery folds are regular and curved except where the robe is over the hands and forearms, and spreads below the hands as if tucked in between the knees. The Buddha's oval face has sharp features almost in a smile and the wavy hair continues into the uṣṇīṣa. His body is broad and the legs and knees crudely large. Above him are one short and two long branches with evenly paired leaves, the long branches with looped garlands; his strewn rectangular seat is unusually low with a simple plinth and a leaf pattern on its face. On the Buddha's left Indra, with hands joined, uttarīya in the narrow mode, wears a now damaged turban, earrings, a collar and bracelets; on the right Brahmā with hands joined, uttarīya across the chest and partly in higher relief, has long hair under a chignon and a horizontal length of hair looped at one end.
The fourth face of the stupa base or harmikā block shows the First Sermon of the Buddha. The haloed Buddha is in abhaya, the left hand rests in the lap and the gathered drapery of the robe spreads onto the seat, while the edges falling on both sides of the right wrist are in prominent relief. A pair of branches with evenly paired leaves, and one branch broken in the middle, form a canopy and on each outer branch hangs a looped floral garland. The Buddha's rectangular strewn seat has a moulded plinth and on its face a triangular motif with indented triangles (stylised opening lotuses alternately inverted). The wheel has twelve spokes. Flanking him obliquely on each side sits a monk with hands in dhyāna covered in the robe, which lies spread with a straight edge between the legs below. The tonsured head of each one is round, sharply cut and with a hairline. Unlike the Buddha's, their seats have a motif of slanting leaves on the face. Behind each monk stands a now headless figure with hands joined: one has a bare right shoulder, the other a variant mode with the right shoulder and upper arm partly covered.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Height: 23.50 centimetres; Width: 34.90 centimetres max. ; Width: 34.30 centimetres min. ,,"Zwalf 1996:
The Bodhisattva was born in the Lumbinī Grove as Māyā held a branch of the śāla or plakṣa which the Bodhisattva's glory had caused to bend towards her in salute. His time in the womb fulfilled, he emerged from Māyā's right side, mindful, conscious and undefiled, causing her no pain, and Indra and Brahmā Sahapati received the child, wrapping his every limb with a silken cloth. In the Saṃghabhedavastu Māyā stood beside a flowering aśoka tree as her time came, Indra protected her modesty by scattering the crowd around her with wind and rain, transformed himself into an old nurse and then received the child on a cloth of antelope skin. In the Pāli tradition, too, the child was born as the mother held a branch of a tree, the śāla, which had bent down towards her, and attendants drew a curtain and retired; the child was successively received on different cloths by the four Mahābrahmās, the four mahārājas and by men.
Scenes of the Birth agree in showing Māyā in the centre, right hand raised and grasping a branch (a complete tree seems never to be shown), legs often crossed at the ankles, the infant emerging half-length and sometimes haloed as here from her right side, while on Māyā's left a female supporter stands in a variety of postures, usually holding Māyā whose left arm rests on one or both of her shoulders. Indra, turbaned and sometimes haloed or, as here, with his cylindrical cap, bends forward with a cloth; behind him is often Brahmā with or without one or more figures worshipping, rejoicing or showing surprise. Behind Māyā's assistant a female often stands holding a palm branch or an Indian equivalent of peacock feathers and sometimes she or a second female holds a spouted pot. At the top of the scene, flanking the branches of the tree, are musical instruments.

From Whitfield 1985:
Although diminutive in comparison with the large composition of the Vulture Peak (Pl. 1), this is a fine work. The Buddha, holding an alms bowl in his right hand, stands full-face. His left hand gathers up his robe with exactly the same gesture seen in the previous embroidery; the robe itself, however, is worked in oblong panels, and the underrobe in stripes, without attempting any elaborate curves. All the outlines –of the Buddha, the nimbus, the mandorla and the flames that surround it – were originally done in gold leaf, which was mounted on paper and cut into very narrow strips and then couched in yellow silk thread. These couching stitches now show up very clearly against the dark paper strips, the gold leaf having largely fallen away. Like other embroideries in this collection, this one is worked on a gauze, probably of complex alternating type (see Pls. 21-26 and Glossary of Textile Terms, p. 345), which is further backed with a very fine plain silk. There supports are both dark purple. Gauze was chosen as a backing probably because its complex structure and ability to stretch eliminated the danger of cutting threads in the support through repeated minute stitches. It also helps to give more substance to the motifs being executed; in fact the whole piece is so tightly packed with stitches that it is quite stiff to handle.
Another tiny embroidered Buddha, from Toyuk, was discovered by Le Coq and shown in New York in the 1982 exhibition Along the Ancient Silk Routes: Central Asian Art from the West Berlin State Museums, being dated eighth to ninth century A.D. in the catalogue (No. 144). Despite size and other points in common (such as the appearance of the hem of the robe as it crosses the shoulder and passes under the right arm, and the closely packed stitches which have been described as “totally cover [ing] the front and back of the fabric”), the Toyuk piece is less formal and hieratic than the one here; the stance is relaxed, and this is reflected in the folds of the robe, which are far more natural than the oblong panels in the Stein example. A piece of silk printed in the jiaxie technique is attached to the Toyuk Buddha, suggesting that it was one of several small Buddhas in the mandorla of a much larger figure. The Stein example may have served a similar purpose but is itself monumental in character despite its small size. The gold leaf of the paper strips, as well as the rich colour of the gauze beneath, must originally have given it added splendour.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
與上圖的大型作品《靈鷲山釋迦說法圖》（圖1）相比，雖然是極小的斷片，但卻是一件出色的作品。佛是右手持缽，正面而立。左手執襟和上圖的姿勢完全一樣。但是衲衣與上圖不同，由看似長方形紋樣連接而成，裏面是縞紋樣，完全看不出表現錯綜複雜曲線的意圖。佛和頭光、身光以及包圍它們的火焰光等的輪廓線所用的金葉，金裱在紙上，切成細絲，然後用黃色絹絲固定住。現在大部分金箔已剝落，黃色絹絲在發黑的紙的線上，清楚的浮現出來了。與其他刺繡品一樣，這個作品也繡在重疊著的薄絹（參見圖21～26，紡織品術語表，p. 345）和有眼平絹上。這兩片絹均是深胭脂色。製作刺繡時使用這種薄絹，可能是因結構複雜，並且有伸縮力，反復刺繡也不用擔心弄斷底線，也那可以有效地表現刺繡的厚重感。實際上，此斷片的刺繡密度很大，很結實。
除此以外，勒柯克在吐峪溝發現的小型刺繡佛立像，1982年在紐約作爲“古代絲綢之路：西柏林國立博物館收藏的中亞美術品”展示时的目錄(No. 144)中，年代記爲8－9世紀。尺寸及其他方面大致相同（例如：從左肩繞到右腋下的衲衣邊的樣子，以及解說中的“帛的裏和面全都覆蓋”的細密繡法等），但吐峪溝的宗教色彩遠比此斷片淡薄，形式也自由。其姿態也很舒展，在其衲衣的褶線上也有體現，與此作品長方形紋樣相比，自然得多。吐峪溝的立佛上有夾纈染的絲綢,暗示著這可能是配在大佛曼陀羅背光上的幾身小佛中的一身。相比之下，本圖的像雖然是小像，但起作用是相同的。當初金葉的金箔與薄絹的絢麗色彩相互輝映，其華麗的程度一定更突出。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

According to the scholar Ma De, Congjiao Monastery refers to the Mogao Grottoes from at least the Sui dynasty to Wu Zetian's reign (690-705).

Most of the stitches are long, around 0.8-1 cm, and split stitches of this sort are similar to satin stitches, perhaps representing a transitional stage between split stitch and satin stitch.
The composition of the embroidery consists of a central Buddha figure beneath a blue canopy, flanked by two disciples and two Bodhisattvas on each side. Below are a number of donors. The Buddha stands on a lotus pedestal with his right shoulder uncovered and his right hand extended straight down, while his left holds the hem of his robe, which is the usual posture for Sakyamuni on this occasion. His body is enclosed, to its full height, within an almond-shaped aureole that reaches to just above the nimbus around his head. Behind the mandorla is a rocky surround, representing the Vulture Peak. At the top of the hanging, on either side of the canopy are apsaras and two lions crouch on either side of the lotus pedestal.
The kneeling donors at the bottom of the hanging are divided into two groups. There are five men at the lower right: one monk, three men wearing modest caps decorated with ribbons which fall down the men's backs and a male servant stands behind them. At the lower left are four seated ladies in high-waisted dresses and shawls or jackets with half sleeves. There is also a small boy beside one lady and a maid standing behind. Most of the embroidered Chinese characters next to the donors can no longer be identified. The central figure of Sakyamuni has escaped damage altogether, while the two Bodhisattvas have suffered only slight damage. The two disciples, partly hidden behind the Bodhisattvas, have suffered the most.

巨型刺繡畫，長方形，表現的是釋迦牟尼在靈鷲山說法的場景。爲使刺繡牢固，使用了兩層繡地——本色絹背襯以本色麻布。繡品中主要使用了自北朝自盛唐間十分流行的劈針針法，但大多數針腳較長，約在0.8-1.0cm左右，應該是介於劈針和平針之間的過渡期。因此，這件繡品的年代不會太晚。
繡品中心是釋迦牟尼的形象，他站在斑駁的岩石之前，這些岩石代表的正是靈鷲山。釋迦牟尼身披紅色袈裟，坦露右肩，赤腳立於蓮座之上，蓮座兩側各有一白色獅子，他的身後有背光和頭光裝飾，右手筆直指向地面，左手在胸前提起袈裟，這是在這類場景中經常出現的姿勢。其頭部上方則是一藍色華蓋，華蓋兩側各有一飛天形象。釋迦牟尼兩側各有一佛弟子和菩薩，均是赤腳立於蓮座之上的形象，菩薩基本上完整地保留了下來，但佛弟子除了頭部之外，身體的其餘部分均已缺失。
繡品的右下方跪著四個男供養人，其中一人爲和尚裝扮，另外三人則均頭戴黑色襆頭，身穿藍色圓領袍，身後是一個站立的男性侍者；左下方是則跪有四個女供養人，頭梳髮髻，身穿窄繡襦，外罩半臂，身系各色長裙，有的披有披帛，一婦女身旁還跪有一男童，他的尺寸特別小，她們身後站立著一個身穿袍服的侍女。供養人身旁的題記上繡有“義明供養”、“一心供養”等字，但多已湮滅不可辨認。
刺繡佛像在唐代十分常見，而且在敦煌文書中也經常可以看到。P.3432《龍興寺卿趙石老腳下依蕃籍所附佛像供養具並經目録等數點檢曆》中載有：“繡像壹片，方圓伍尺”；“繡阿彌陀像壹，長三箭，闊兩箭，帶色絹”。唐時一尺約爲30cm，吐蕃時期的一箭約等於50cm，即前一件繡像約方圓150cm，後一件繡阿彌陀佛像長150cm、寬100cm，比此件小。

From Whitfield 1985:
This is one of the most magnificent of all the compositions found in the hidden library at Dunhuang. As an embroidery it may rank with the Shaka Nyōrai Preaching, of similar size (207×157cm) and also of the eighth century, from the Kanshū-in, now in the Nara National Museum (see Nihon bukkyō bijutsu no genryū, p.254). Other items of embroidery in the Stein Collection at the British Museum are of a decorative character, but this work must have been equal in importance to the finest and largest of the paradise paintings on silk. 
The composition consists of a five-figured Buddha group, over which appears a canopy with apsarasas, and below are a number of donors. The Buddha stands on a lotus pedestal, beneath the blue canopy. His body is enclosed, to its full height, within an almond-shaped aureole that reaches to just above the nimbus around his head. Behind the mandorla is a rocky surround, representing Mt.Grdhrakūta, or the Vulture Peak, at Rājagrha, the scene of the preaching of the Lotus Sutra. The Buddha stands with his right shoulder uncovered and his right hand extended straight down, while his left grasps the hem of his robe, in the usual posture for Sākyamuni on this occasion (see also Vol.1, Pl.22). 
By good fortune and through the care with which the whole embroidery was folded, the central figure of Sākyamuni has escaped damage altogether, while the two Bodhisattvas have suffered only slight losses. It is the two disciples, already partly hidden behind the Bodhisattvas, who have been damaged the worst: as Stein noted in Serindia (Vol.Ⅱ, p.983), these figures fell along the line of folding when the hanging was put away, “and have for the most part been eaten away. ”Enough of the two figures survives, however, to reveal their individual characters and to show that their robes originally just touched the outermost contours of the rocky cliff. The two Bodhisattvas are almost completely visible. They and the disciples stand on lotus pedestals and seen in three-quarter view. As they are placed just in front of and a little below the disciples, the effect of the whole composition is to form a space enclosing the central Buddha, echoing the arrangement that would have been found if the group had been a sculptural one. 
This feeling for space and volume, despite the medium of embroidery in which it must have been especially difficult to achieve, is in itself powerful evidence of a date of execution early in the Tang dynasty when such concerns are characteristic of both sculpture and painting. That there were sculptural models for Sākyamuni on the Vulture Peak, though distant in time and space, is suggested by the presence of this representation in the New Delhi section of the painting of Famous Buddhist Images (see Vol.2, text figure, p.306), where Sākyamuni appears alone, against a rocky background. In that painting, several features indicate that the figure of Sākyamuni reflects, although not at first hand, a sculpture in stone. Like many of the other figures in the Famous Buddhist Images painting, this one is not coloured, but simply represented in ink outline. The mandorla enclosing the figure is straight at the sides and semicircular at the top, where it completely encloses the nimbus; its form and the small seated Buddha visible above Sākyamuni’s right shoulder strongly suggest that the original model was a free-standing stone stele. Only beyond its confines are there long coloured flames, and outside these the rocky forms of the Vulture Peak shaded in ink and some of them coloured. This seems appropriate in a painting which was primarily a record of famous images. 
Among the wall paintings at Dunhuang, the Sākyamuni Preaching on the Vulture Peak, in Cave 332, datable to the early Tang (Chūgoku Sekkutsu, Tonkō Makkōkutsu, Vol.3, Pl.88) is close to the embroidery in scale and composition. The scene is painted on the north face of the pillar behind the main images, in the corridor at the back of the cave. Sākyamuni, clad in a red robe, stands between two Bodhisattvas, Avalokitesvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta. His nimbus and mandorla have a broad edging of flames, and the outlines of cliffs and mountain peaks appear behind. There are no disciples, and three canopies rather than one complete the composition. The colours in the wall painting have suffered a good deal of abrasion and loss, so that a detailed comparison is not possible. As a general impression, however, the figure of Sākyamuni appears somewhat stiffer, the robe pulled up tightly under the right arm, crossing the chest almost horizontally rather than falling gracefully in a single curve from the left shoulder. In both figures the edges of the outer garment are seen to wave (revealing a lining of a different colour) across the chest, around the shoulder and upper left arm and as two wavy edges falling from the gathering in the Buddha’s left hand. The more schematic character of the wall painting can be judged in this last fall, since the waves are juxtaposed and mirror each other exactly, while in the embroidery each pursues its own rhythm, and the differences in the undulations help to reveal the shape of the figure. The schematic character of the wall painting is on the whole closer to the depiction of Sākyamuni in the Famous Buddhist Images painting than to the embroidery: note especially the way in which the upper edge of the robe is brought up close under the right arm, and the stiff waves of the edges of the robe. The same double lines are used, however, in both the silk painting and the embroidery to indicate drapery folds, so all three depictions have points in common. In the embroidery, frequent slight variations in colour enhance the liveliness already present in the initial outlines-each fold is narrowly outlined in blue, always following the underdrawing in ink, which is visible in every place where the threads are broken or missing. 
Turning to the depiction of the facial features in the several figures of this embroidery, we can observe subtle variations here also. The elderly disciple on Buddha’s left has the most vigorous appearance, with blue outlines strongly accenting all the main lines and even outlining his teeth, and used in a regular vertical crosshatching of the eyebrow, indicated on the silk ground beneath by an area of ink wash. The iris of his eye is painted in black ink directly on the silk ground without any overlying embroidery. Of the face of his companion opposite, enough remains to show that he had smooth features: the iris is again rendered in black ink on the silk ground, but the eyebrow above is embroidered with long thin stitches of blue interspersed with others of the pale silvery silk used for the rest of the head, so that the eyebrow appears smooth and delicate. In the Bodhisattvas, the eyebrows are indicated by single blue arcs as are the inner upper edge of the orbit and the almond-shaped contour of the eye. The iris is painted in ink, not on the silk ground beneath, but on the embroidery. The nose is outlined with a single line of stitches once perhaps tinged with red but now faded to a very pale yellow, as have the lips. 
Even greater care was taken with the countenance of the Buddha. His hair is of the deepest indigo, edged in the lighter blue that also outlines the face and models the ears. In the centre of the hair at the base of the usnisa, this same lighter blue frames a small circle of the exposed white silk ground representing a jewel. The slender, finely arched eyebrows are in a lighter shade than the indigo used for the hair. The eyes, outlined in blue, are filled with horizontal rows of chain stitch in a whiter silk than the rest of the face: against this the irises, painted in black ink directly on the silk ground, stand out clearly and indeed seem have been lightly padded from behind so as to appear slightly raised. The edges of the eye orbit, the whole of the nose, the mouth, complemented by associated modelling lines and chin line. Are all in a golden colour. For the rest of the face, the rows of stitches follow both the outer contours and the inner features, thus revealing the whole circle of the orbit merely through the arrangement of the stitches. The dramatic effect of the modelling must originally have been much strengthened by differences of colour: today many of these colours have greatly faded, while the blues of the indigo have remained strong since they were initially created by oxidation. 
Although these subtleties only reveal themselves on close examination, they do account for the extraordinary presence of the figures, and testify to the early date of the whole composition. Only in the early and high Tang do we find such close and constant attention to details that constantly serve to enhance the movement and form of the figures. Details such as the hands of the two Bodhisattvas show great sensitivity: those of the Bodhisattva on Buddha’s right are in anjalimudrā, palms pressed together, but with the index of right hand just crooked behind the rest. On Buddha’s left, the Bodhisattva’s right hand is extended, palm outwards; the thumb is missing but the wrist is intact and completely relaxed. Wrist and fingers are again seen to perfection in the left hand: no opportunity to depict graceful movement has been lost. In all these details the embroidery has followed the original cartoon in ink, which set out even such minor details as the flowers and buds scattered by the heavenly beings above. It invites comparison with the most delicate of the early Tang wall paintings, such as the Bodhisattva as Guide of Souls in Cave 205(Vol.2, text figure, p.302), or a donor in Cave 401(Chūgoku Sekkutsu, Tonkō Makkōkutsu, Vol.3, Pl.7). 
Such comparisons inviting an early date are confirmed when we examine the demure attitudes of the donors below: the ladies in high-waisted dresses, with shoulder shawls: the men with modest cap-ribbons falling naturally; while at the top the canopy is of the domed kind, with curved ribs and segments alternating in colour, that we have already seen in the Representations of Famous Buddhist Images(Vol.2, Fig.9). 
As noted above, the panel, apart from the losses sustained through long storage in a folded state, is in an amazingly good state of repair. The edges on both sides have been well preserved, and very little, if any, of the top and bottom edges has been lost, other than perhaps a few centimetres of unembroidered space. The panel is made up of hemp cloth, now visible in many place, although this was originally entirely covered by thin silk of a balanced close weave. Although this silk has now largely perished, it can still be seen easily, particularly in the upper left corner. Both the thin silk ground and the hemp cloth support are in fact formed of three widths of material sewn together, the seams being completely hidden when beneath the embroidery, but now easily visible on the plain ground due to the better preservation of the silk along the edges of the seams. After the embroidery reached London, it was couched on a new linen backing and mounted on a stretcher as a panel. For many years it hung in a glazed frame on the landing of the North Staircase of the British Museum, protected by a curtain. When the upstairs galleries were renovated in 1971, a special case was prepared for it so that it is frequently on view at entrance to Oriental Gallery Ⅱ. 
Close examination of the embroidery shows that the design was first drawn in outline in ink directly onto the silk ground. Following this preliminary drawing, the main contours were first worked, most of them in dark blue silk, in lines of split stitch. In some places, for example in the contours of the rock of the mountain and in some of the drapery of the Bodhisattva on the left, these outlines were done in brown instead of blue. After this each of the areas enclosed by the outlines was filled by closely packed soft unplied floss silk. Stein describes this as “worked solid in satin stitch, ”but it many perhaps be split stitch, with long over-lapping stitches to produce a satiny finish. In general these lines fill the area in the same way that a field many be ploughed, following the outer boundaries and gradually reducing the area left to be done. There are , however, a number of variations: in many places the outlines are dispensed with and, just as in kesi (kossu; 緙絹) weave, a consistent division produces a line within a single colour, as in the centre line of the breast of the Bodhisattva on the right. This technique is also used in conjunction with a change of colour, for instance on the breast of the Buddha himself; it is used again to mark the edges of the petals in the lotus pedestals, and of the floral motifs in the embroidered hems of the garments of the two Bodhisattvas. The rock structure of the Vulture Peak, in several colours, is distinguished both by outlines in blue or brown, and occasionally by setting the filling stitches at right angles in adjacent facets of the rock, giving a sharp variation in reflectance. 
Within each area so filled, there are subtle variations in colour, as well as differences in the length of stitch and type of silk used. For most of the large areas, the silk used is a single, rather full, unplied floss silk, and the stitches are long, often between 8 and 10 mm in length, giving a satiny appearance. In many places, however, as it was worked behind the needle, the two strands of the silk lightly twisted together (within each strand the silk is of course untwisted): this can be seen for example in the blue rock. In places where the silk is finer, this twisting of the strands is correspondingly tighter, as can be seen in some areas of the Bodhisattvas’ robes. Sometimes the stitches were much shorter in order to give a different surface texture. The clearest example of this is in the stitch (still a split stitch but with short stitches instead of long ones) used for the Buddha’s extended right arm. Here a totally different effect is achieved since each line of split stitch, instead of being closely packed, is quite separate from its neighbours, leaving the underlying thin silk ground clearly visible. When the embroidery was new, this technique must have resulted in an enhanced luminosity of the forearm and hand, distinct from the golden colour of the upper arm and shoulder; indeed this is still true today. In the hand itself, the way in which the lines of stitches follow the curves of the fleshy parts of the palm and fingers can be seen directly in the plate (Pl.1-2). The outlines of this hand and of the arm right up to the shoulder are in a silk which today appears completely black, without a hint of blue.; Chinese

這幅刺繡作品色彩豐富，技藝精湛，是敦煌藏經洞出土的最優秀的作品之一。從刺繡的做工上說，可與奈良國立博物館藏（勸修寺舊藏）的《釋迦牟尼說法圖繡帳》 (見《日本佛教美術源流》，254頁)相媲美（該作品製作於8世紀，尺寸爲207×157cm）。大英博物館所藏的斯坦因收集品中，還有其他一些刺繡作品，但多是裝飾性的，而該作品則同其他絹繪淨土圖一樣氣勢壯觀。
此圖由五尊佛像構成，上部是華蓋和飛天，下部是衆多的供養人像。佛陀站立在青色華蓋遮敝的蓮華寶座上，扁桃形的身光環繞著身體與頭光等高。曼陀羅的背後有一座岩山，可以想見，這是《法華經》中所說的靈鷲山。佛陀偏袒右肩，右手垂直下放，左手執衣襟。這是所有靈鷲山釋迦牟尼說法圖中所共有的一種姿勢（參見卷1，圖22）。
該刺繡曾長期疊放在藏經洞中，所以兩尊菩薩的像有部分破損，幸運的是主尊釋迦牟尼保存完好，菩薩略有殘損，而破損最嚴重的是兩尊菩薩背後只露出半個身子的兩尊弟子的像。造成這種破損的原因，正如斯坦因在《西域》（Serindia，卷2，983頁）中分析的那樣，是在人們取下畫上的吊繩折疊存放時，這些部位正好處在折線上。在斯坦因發現它時，這些像就已幾乎散失，但通過殘存部分仍能辨別出這二尊弟子的容貌，也能確認他們的衣物本是連在突兀的斷崖上的。二尊菩薩基本保存完好，和二尊弟子一樣，斜向前方站立在蓮華座上。他們緊挨弟子站在前方，在圖中的位置比弟子略低。主尊周圍各尊佛像的這種佈局，與我們在雕像中所見到的各尊佛像的陳列方式一樣，顯現出一定的空間進深。從技術上說，用刺繡是很難表現出空間感和量感的，但是這副作品卻實現了這一點。這一特點有力地証明了該作品的製作爲初唐時期。因為在初唐時期，無論是繪畫還是雕刻，人們都越來越注重表現空間感和量感。
新德里國立博物館藏的《釋迦牟尼瑞像圖》（參見卷2，解說插圖，306頁）中也有用岩山做背景的釋迦牟尼獨尊像。雖然兩幅作品産生的年代和地點相差很遠，但可以推測，過去確實存在有一座雕像，《靈鷲山釋迦牟尼說法圖》中的釋迦牟尼就是依據這座雕像創作的。《瑞像圖》中的釋迦牟尼像雖然沒有直接摹寫石雕像，但在很多地方我們都能夠找到石雕像的影子。以岩山做背景的佛像，與其他諸像一樣，只使用墨線而無色彩。環繞佛像的背光，兩側爲豎立的直線，上端呈半圓形，項光被完全納入其中。這種背光的表現形式、釋迦牟尼右肩上方的小坐像，使人強烈地感到這幅作品是以石雕爲原型創作的。只有彩色的長長的火焰光越出了背光的界線，外側是墨線勾勒的彩色的靈鷲山岩石，這種表現手法正適合於該作品記錄瑞像的目的。
在敦煌壁畫中，初唐時期建造的第332窟（《中國石窟•敦煌莫高窟》卷3，圖88）的壁畫裏，也有與此非常相似的《靈鷲山釋迦牟尼說法圖》。該圖繪在洞內後方回廊部位的方柱北面，釋迦牟尼身裹紅色袈裟，兩側站立著觀音、勢至二尊菩薩。背光和項光附有寬大的火焰紋，背後用線描繪出了斷崖或山上裸露的岩石。畫中沒有弟子，只有三頂華蓋，而非完整構圖。壁畫的色彩漫漶、脫落嚴重，無法對細節部分進行比較和研究。
然而，此壁畫給人的整體印象是，釋迦牟尼的像比較生硬，通常從左肩用柔和的弧線來描繪的衣服，在此用斜線幾乎橫切前胸，看似牢牢夾在右腋下方。外衣的邊緣呈波浪狀（能看到襯裏的不同顔色）；外衣從胸前穿過，從肩繞至左上臂，集中到左手，再從左手處形成兩條紐帶垂落下來。這些細節與本圖中的佛像相同。比較雙方對最後紐帶部分的處理，可以看出壁畫相對顯得有些形式化。壁畫中，紐帶的波紋兩條兩條地整齊地並列在一起，而刺繡中二條紐帶則分別有著自己的運動節奏，呈現出不同的波浪起伏，這種處理方法有助於刻畫釋迦牟尼的形象。
從整體上看，與本圖的刺繡作品相比，此幅壁畫的形式化的表現方法，更接近於《釋迦牟尼瑞像圖》。特別是橫過前胸的衲衣上端被右腋牢牢夾住、衲衣邊緣的波浪起伏用直線生硬地勾畫，這些都很引人注目。而另一方面，絹繪的瑞像圖和本刺繡作品中，衣褶都用雙線表示，所以說三者之間存在共同點。刺繡作品中，僅有的幾種顔色變化頻繁，進一步增加了樣本已具有的生動感。袈裟則用藍色線沿著底稿的墨線細緻地刻畫，在那些絲線已斷裂、缺失的地方，我們還可以看到底稿的墨線。
再看諸佛的面容，其表現也有一些細微的變化。表情最爲生動的，是站在如來左邊的年老弟子，包括牙齒的輪廓線在內，主要線條均用藍色突出出來。眉毛是在絹底上用淡墨畫的，粗粗的，上用線繡出一些細毛。黑眼珠是在絹底上直接用墨描繪的，沒用刺繡。右側弟子面部雖然只殘留一小部分，但能看出他表情柔和。黑眼珠也是在絹底上用墨點出的，眉毛則使用藍色線，針腳細而長。臉部到頭部使用淡銀色線，幾種顔色搭配在一起，顯得柔和、細膩。
二菩薩的眉毛與眼窩線及杏核眼的輪廓，都使用了一根藍色的弧線來表示。而黑眼珠沒畫在絹底上，是用墨繪在了刺繡上。鼻梁線與嘴唇線使用了相同的顔色，當初可能是淡紅色，但現在已褪變爲黃色。
佛陀的面容更是下了許多功夫。頭髮是深藏青色，臉部、耳朵的輪廓線都使用了明快的藍色。頭髮中央的肉髻珠的位置，留出了圓形的白色絹底，周圍圈以明快的藍色，看似寶石。細細的眉毛呈優美的弧形，顏色與頭髮的深藏青色相比有淡淡的陰影。眼睛輪廓爲藍色，眼白則用比臉部還白的絹絲，採用鎖繡的手法水平刺繡而成。而黑眼珠則是在絹底上直接用墨描繪。黑眼珠具有鮮明的立體感，其實是在下面墊了東西使其稍稍凸出來一點。眼窩、鼻、唇、下顎以及裸露的身體，均使用金黃色。面部其他部分則分別沿著臉的輪廓線和五官的輪廓線刺繡而成，看起來像是打著漩兒。裸露的身體當初肯定有著強烈的色彩變化，但現在，大部分已褪色，只有深藏青色還殘留著它的鮮豔。
只有在對該作品進行仔細的研究之後，我們才能發現這些細節部分的精妙之處。這些細節不僅表現出其在佛像刻畫中的非凡之處，也證明了該作品本身的製作年代之早。因爲這種極其注重細節並以此提高佛像生動感的特色，只在初唐到盛唐間的作品中才能見得到。
再看二尊菩薩的手，我們會發現對細節部分的刻畫幾乎到了細緻入微的地步。如，合掌侍立在釋迦牟尼右側的菩薩，右手食指彎曲，藏在其他手指的陰影裏。侍立在左側的菩薩，右手伸開，掌心向外，拇指雖已殘缺，但手腕處保存完好，並表現出了柔弱無力的樣子。其左手的手腕和手指完整地保留至今，仍然優雅生動。這種細節是沿著底稿上的墨線用刺繡來刻畫的。圖上方飛天周圍散落的花朵、花蕾等細節的刻畫方法也與此相同。
綜上所述，和敦煌初唐時期的壁畫相比，該作品可以和第205窟西壁的《引路菩薩圖》（卷2，解說插圖，306頁）、第401窟的《供養菩薩圖》（《中國石窟•敦煌莫高窟》卷3，圖7）等最爲精緻的壁畫相媲美。
可與這些早期作品相媲美的地方，還有對圖下部供養人像文雅姿態的刻畫：女供養人在齊胸的裙子外披肩巾、男供養人柔軟垂落的襆頭等。另外，圓頂華蓋是通過表現不同的材料的交互將顔色分開，在《釋迦牟尼瑞像圖》（卷2，Fig.9）中也能見到這種表現方式。
前面已經介紹過，由於此作品被長時間折疊存放，除殘損部分外，其餘部分保存完好得令人驚訝。畫面的兩端都完好無損，上下邊即使是保存下來，也不過是數釐米沒有刺繡圖案的絹底。
此作品本來是在麻布上鋪了一層質地緻密的薄絹。薄絹已損壞相當嚴重，但畫面右上部的部分卻殘留了下來。整個作品是用三幅這種薄絹面和麻布裏重疊的布料縫合而成的，縫合的針眼本應是完全隱蔽在刺繡下面的，但現在，部分針眼在絹面上已經隨處可見。
此繡品運送到倫敦以後，被重新用麻布裱褙，變得象幅油畫一樣，還加上了玻璃鏡框。在很長一段時間裏，覆蓋著幕布挂在大英博物館北部樓梯的平臺上。到了1971年，博物館二層陳列室改建時，才被放進特製的匣子裏，擺放在東方繪畫陳列室入口處顯眼的地方。
仔細查看該作品，我們會發現其是先將底樣直接描繪在絹底上，然後照樣刺繡的。主線基本上是用深藏青色絲線割繡。但有一部分如裸露的山石、侍立右側的菩薩的袈裟等等，則用褐色取代了藏青色。然後用柔軟的單股絹絲認真填平用線圈起來的範圍，雖然斯坦因稱其爲緞繡，但從其長而平滑的針腳看，恐怕應是割繡。
一般來說，用刺繡填埋輪廓線內的空白，就像耕地一樣，沿輪廓線來回做往復運動，逐漸縮小空白部分。但在這裏，不只是用這種方法，而是産生了各種變化。不僅運用直線針，更多則採用織錦似的針法，如侍立左側的菩薩胸部的中線，就是在同種色線繡出的部位中加上非常明顯的分界線。此種手法，除了使釋迦牟尼胸部顔色更具變化外，也使蓮華座的花瓣兒更醒目、二尊菩薩的衣邊兒花紋爲更突出。背景中岩石臨接的地方使用相互垂直的針腳，表現出了岩石表面的凹凸不平。
在填埋各部分時，通過變換針腳的長短或所用絲線的種類來産生色彩的微妙變化。面積較大的部分則幾乎都是使用未撚的單股線，針腳有8－10mm，表面顯得很有光澤。但很多地方繡針在往返時使兩股線輕輕地撚在了一起（單股線不用撚）。這一特點在岩山的青色部分表現得非常明顯，而且在菩薩的衣裳上也是隨處可見，用細線繡的部分，線都撚在一起，非常細密。同時這些地方針腳較短，表面的感覺也略有不同。其中一個明顯的例子，就是釋迦牟尼伸向下方的右手，上下部分的繡法雖然相同，但針腳從上部到下部逐漸由長變短。並且，下部所繡的各線沒有緊密填補空間，針與針之間有距離，從隙間露出了薄絹底，産生出與上部完全不同的效果。
與我們今天所看到的情形不同，這幅作品在剛完成時，前臂和手掌因這種技法而産生了與金色的肩部和上臂部不同的效果，其亮度要更大一些。這種效果現在還沒有完全消失，從手部擴大圖（圖1－2）上可以看到，刺繡的線沿著手掌及手指的曲線描繪出不同的弧度。現在，其手的前部及手腕到肩等處的輪廓線變成了黑色，已看不出原來的藍色了。; Zwalf 1985
This splendid embroidery, as large as any Dunhuang paintings found by Stein, shows the Buddha in the rocky surround of the Vulture Peak (Ghṛdhrakūṭa) at Rājagṛha preaching the ‘Lotus Sūtra’.

Rawson 1994:
All types of textile art flourished during the Tang dynasty (AD 618-906) in China. An important group of Tang textiles has recently been found in excavations at the Famensi at Fufeng, in Shaanxi province; gifts to this monastery evidently included clothing as well as glass, silver and ceramics. Embroidery also continued to be developed and was used for large images of the Buddha built up in satin and chain stitch. Most of the textiles found by Aurel Stein at Dunhuang in Gansu province, including banners, altar hangings and monks' apparel, follow the Buddhist convention of being made up of small cut pieces of different cloth. These 'patchwork' items provide an invaluable cross-section of the different types of silk cloth and embroidery available at the time (BM MAS.857).
Trade along the Silk Route was at its most vigorous during the Tang dynasty, and travellers record the bazaars of the Middle East as being full of Chinese patterned cloth and embroideries. Simultaneously we are told that the Tang capital at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) was populated by large numbers of Iranian craftsmen. A silk weave now known as ""weft-faced compound twill"" appears among Chinese textiles for a few centuries from about AD 700. This may well have been a technique introduced by foreign weavers, as it seems to have been developed originally in Iran. In the West it was particularly associated with repeating designs of roundels enclosing paired or single animals, with flower heads or rosettes between the roundels (BM MAS.876 and 877). The scroll design with flowers and birds occurs in ceramics and other decorative arts from the Tang dynasty onwards.; The Getty's curatorial team suggests the title as Miraculous Image of Liangzhou (Fanhe Buddha)","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
When found, this panel was sewn in the form of an oblong cover, folded in half and joined along one edge and the two ends. It is embroidered on a white damask lined with plain white silk, and a selvedge is visible along one edge of both fabrics. The damask itself is in a floral design, although this is hard to see beneath the exuberant scrolling embroidered stems, leaves and flowers which are evenly disposed over the whole surface of the piece, with small ducks in flight between the stems. Apart from their eyes, beaks and wing-patches in silk, the birds are worked solid in plied silk thread rolled with strips of gold-leafed paper, the threads running in pairs and couched with fine silk. The stems, flowers and leaves are edged with a single thread similarly covered in silver-leafed paper, though this has mainly perished.
All these edges were applied as the finishing touch to the piece, after stems had been worked in split stitch and the leaves and petals had been filled in with satin stitch. In places where the indigo thread of the stems has been broken, one can still see faint traces of the ink used to outline the design. The use of the silk was very economical: often the stitches on the front are 8 or 9 mm long, and on the back barely 1 mm as the needle returns, splitting the silk, to go forward another long stitch on the front. The scrolling stems are all connected and begin in the middle on the selvedge side. Along the opposite side the design evidently continued, and there is every reason to suppose that it did so over a full width of silk, a width more than twice the present 24 cm. At the top and bottom, the stems and leaves conform with the straight line of the edge, so nothing has been lost there. The form in which it was discovered, as a bag or cover, must the have been a form of re-use, after part of the embroidery had been cut off.
Throughout, the work displays the qualities of Tang floral art at its best. In addition to the many variations of colour in the flowers, the leaves are worked in green and indigo to suggest twists and turns. For a denser treatment of the same foliage motif, one might instance the edges of the stele to the Chan Master of Great Wisdom, in the Beilin at Xi’an, which is dated the 24 th year of Kaiyuan (A.D.736).; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
發現當初，這是將長條布對折，縫合了三面的長方形袋子。白絹做裏子，在白綾上進行刺繡，一端能看到兩片絹的織邊。底子的綾也有花色圖案，被刺繡遮蓋在下邊，無法分辨。刺繡以唐草花紋爲主，配滿了花和葉子，花草叢中有看似鴛鴦的小鳥飛翔。小鳥除眼和嘴外，還有一部分翅膀使用絹絲，其餘全都是兩根並排的撚金葉，並用細絹絲做了固定。莖、花、葉子，脫落的部分也多是用一根銀葉鑲邊。製作程序是先繡好莖，再用孺子繡繡葉子和花瓣，等所有的刺繡結束後再鑲邊。在紺色線刺繡的莖的損壞部分，仍然可以見到淺淺的底稿墨線。絹絲的使用很珍惜：正面常常是繡出8～9毫米長的刺繡針腳，在背面翻回僅有1毫米左右長，再在面上繡下個長針腳的方法。莖的曲線從織邊的中央部位開始，連成一枝。很明顯，此圖案在織邊的對側一面還有延續，可能原來是在比現在的24釐米的寬兩倍左右的整幅絹上進行的刺繡。上端和下端的莖和葉子沒有斷，所以沒有受到損傷。發現時，其形狀像袋子或套子，那可能斷開的是更大的一塊刺繡布料，被再利用而成的。
通盤考慮這件刺繡的圖案設計，完全展示了唐代達到最高峰時期的花紋風格。此外其上面的花有各種色彩變化，葉子是用綠色和深紺色表現纏繞或翻轉。同樣稠密的花紋還可舉出有開元二十四年（736年）的西安碑林之《大智禪師碑》的邊飾花紋。; Rawson 1994:

長方形帷幔，在斯坦因發現的三件帷幔中這是最完整的一件，另兩件收藏在印度新德里。此件帷幔上方是一條由十塊織物拼縫而成的寬邊，釘有由八個分別由絹或緯錦製成的挂攀，下方有兩層，底層由各種織物拼縫而成作底，外層由各種織物製成三角形狀的飾片，釘於寬片之下，中層是鱗形、條形、結形等各種形制的垂帶，由絹、素羅、暗花羅、綺、綾、錦以及刺繡品等各種織物製成。這種垂帶在不同的場合可以稱爲蒜條、額帶或流蘇，我們在此統一稱爲垂帶。
《周禮•天官•幕人》載：“幕人掌帷幕幄帟綬之事”，揚之水在《帷幄故事》中認爲：“幕是上覆，帷是下圍，而圍又未必是圍繞，它的在旁也可只用間隔之用。”因此我們統一稱其爲帷幔。類似於此種型制的帷幔在敦煌繪畫中經常可以看見，但用處卻時有不同。從這件帷幔的尺寸大小來看，它有可能用於多種場合。一是用於祭壇或供案的周圍，此時可以稱爲案裙或桌帷（桌圍），敦煌壁畫上有不少同類例示。二是用於佛像前的帳額，或稱帷幔。P.3432《龍興寺卿趙石老腳下依蕃籍所附佛像供養具並經目録等數點檢曆》載：“佛帳額上金渡銅花並白鏹花，三面畫垂額壹。”這裏的三面所畫的垂額在與佛帳同處時應爲帳額。三是大型傘蓋周圍的傘裙，正如V&A博物館所藏彩繪麻布傘蓋（LOAN:STEIN.620）所例示的傘蓋四周的裙沿，均繪以流蘇狀物，正是對實際垂帶的描繪。

From Whitfield 1985:
The survival of something once commonplace in the Buddhist temples of China and now so rare as this altar valance testifies to the wide range of the objects preserved in the sealed library of Cave 17 at Dunhuang. Of the three valances found by Stein there, this is the most complete; the other two are now in New Delhi. Painted representations of valances are extremely common among the wall paintings, and there are some handsome examples among the silk paintings as well, notably the top edge of the Paradise of Sakyamuni (Vol.1, Pl. 8-2). The basic elements of that painted valance are essentially the same as those of the one shown here: a broad top border, there of plain red silk, with an elaborate floral design, and hanging from this border a row of triangular elements, from which in the painting long tassels and small tabs hang in regular alternation. In the textile presented here, the row of triangular pieces of cloth is actually double. At their points hang little tabs or rosettes, while longer tassels hang from behind. Some of these long tassels are made of a single piece of material, often striking in colour or decoration, while others are made up of overlapping points of silk in different colours. Both the textile valance and the painted one contain white streamers tied with a symmetrical double bow. The little tabs are stuffed with small pieces of silk, and three of them take the form of human figures, one a female with a face of white damask and with features indicated in apricot silk. Behind all the hanging elements is a curtain made up of larger pieces of plain silk.
There are over seventy pieces of material in all (see the sketch and enumeration of the component parts, Fig.5), comprising most of the varieties of fabrics represented in the Stein Collection, and at least one piece, of a ribbed silk, which is not otherwise represented. Though the valance is a rich source of information on the types of textile to be found at Dunhuang, its main value is as a complete assembly (only a few streamers at the right-hand end are missing), showing how every scrap of silk was saved and put to use as a furnishing for an altar or a canopy in one of the temples or caves.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
像这样的垂幕應該是在中國古代佛教寺院中最普通的，而現在卻极缺乏样例，這一例只能說明敦煌第17窟藏經洞收藏的物品之廣泛。斯坦因帶回的三件，這件保存狀態最爲完整，其他兩件為新德里國立博物館收藏。壁畫中多見描繪這種垂幕的範例，另外在絹繪作品中也有幾件精美的例子。在那些之中，特別引人注目的是《報恩經變相圖》畫面上端描繪的垂幕（第1卷圖8），其基本结构與本圖的垂幕大致相同：那繪畫上端的寬橫帶，是在淡綠色平絹上繪着美麗花紋，從橫帶垂落的三角形的裝飾，还有長穗飾和小玉飾從這裏交錯而有规律的垂下。本織品三角形的裝飾是兩層的，其中幾個上面還綴著小飾物。然后再從那後面垂下幾條很長的裝飾布，其多数爲一塊布做成，色彩和裝飾對比強烈。還可見與此不同的是各種色絹重疊在一起的布條。另外，無論是此實物垂幕還是繪畫中的垂幕，都有白色的蝴蝶結垂飾。小飾物是內塞滿小絹布而成，有三個是人形，其中一個臉部用白綾，眼睛和鼻子是紅色絹絲作成的女性形象。所有垂饰背後，有很大的平絹布做的幕。
此垂幕是由七十多塊小片組成的（從素描和结构一覽表看，Fig.5），是斯坦因收集的染織品中最富變化的。斯坦因的收集品中，除此件外，至少還有一件本書未採用的棱形垂幕。根据那些垂幕，可以獲得有關敦煌出土的各類染織品的豐富線索，然而無論怎么说，其真正價值在於作爲完整的作品被保留下來這一點上（只是右端部分的飾物佚失幾件），可以看出是如何收集小片的絹，把它們缝合起來，用於寺院或石窟的祭壇以及華蓋装饰的。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
Each side of this plaque carries a figure of the Buddha in an identical standing position, the right hand in abhaya-mudra, conferring absence of fear. On the side seen here, he is clad in a red robe, within an oval vesica which has lost all pigment. The details of the face are outlined in red on a white ground, while the folds of the robe are in ink. On the other side (Fig. 95). The Buddha is unclad save for a loin cloth; the hands are in the same mudra. Much of the white pigment has been lost, but a few details such as the vajra on the forearm and the double rings on the upper legs show that this is Vairocana, the Buddha in his cosmic aspect, with various forms (in which he may exist) depicted on, meaning within, his body.
Eiichi Matsumoto, in a series of articles in 1936 (Kokka, nos. 548, 549, 551), was the first to point out the importance of Khotan as a centre of the Avatamsaka Sutra and in its eastward propagation from the fifth century or even earlier until the close of the eighth century. Between A.D. 418 and 421 the first Chinese translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra was made by Buddhabhadra from a Sanskrit version of the sutra obtained from Khotan. More recently, the problems of the iconography of Khotanese Buddhism have been explored by Joanna Williams (1973, pp. 117-24), who was able to find still more examples of the Cosmic Vairocana among the extant remnants of the art of Khotan. Those shown in this volume include a fragment of a wall painting from Khadalik (Pl. 53-4) and a plaque from Farhad-beg-yailaki (Pl. 72), as well as the present example. Still other wall paintings and plaques have been published by Gerd Gropp (1974; see especially pp. 132-33).
The style revealed in these two figures shows little evidence of Chinese influence. The whole of each figure conforms closely to the shallow curves of the surrounding vesica; the legs are almost straight, the arms held close to the sides, the head a large oval with features almost geometrically disposed. In the robed figure of Pl. 71 the drapery lines still echo fairly closely the classical Gandharan arrangement, the left hand holding a loop of robe. At Dunhuang we find more movement even in the figures of the earliest caves, while the first example of the Cosmic Vairocana, from Cave 428 of the Northern Zhou (A.D. 550-57) already shows a more developed type of Vairocana, no longer naked but clad in an ample robe on which are depicted scenes of Mt. Sumeru (Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, Vol. 1, Pl. 162). Thus the sixth century would appear to be the latest possible date for the plaque.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此木板畫的兩面都繪著右手結施無畏印的佛立像。本圖所揭示的面上，佛穿赤褐色衣，有橢圓形頭光，但頭光的顔色幾乎全部殘失。佛的臉部則是在白底上施以紅色的輪廓線，衣褶則用墨綫。背面（Fig. 95）的佛是以布纏腰的裸身，手印與前相同，白色顔料大多已脫落，從前膊的金剛杵及膝蓋上方雙層的輪等特徵可看出是毘廬遮那佛，身上畫著各種形象（其中也包括佛）。
松本榮一博士于1936年發表的一系列論文（《國華》，第548、549、551號）中首次指出了于闐作爲《華嚴經》中心的重要性，以及《華嚴經》的東漸是從5世紀或稍早些到8世紀末。而418年至421年間佛馱跋陀羅首次進行的《華嚴經》漢譯，也是譯自從于闐獲得的梵文經典。對於和田的佛教圖像，近年Joanna Williams進行了調查（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973年，頁117-124），從大量和田繪畫中發現了許多毘廬遮那佛像。本書所舉出的毘廬遮那佛像的作品，除本圖外，還可見於喀達里克的壁畫斷片（圖53－4）以及法哈特伯克亞依拉克（末城）的木板畫（圖72），而在Gerd Gropp的著作（1974年，特別是頁132-133）中還其他壁畫和木板畫的例子。
這兩個圖像在風格上幾乎感覺不到中國影響的因素。身體恰好容在用流暢的線條繪的身光裏，兩腿筆直，兩臂緊貼在身體兩側，橢圓形的頭部幾乎是用幾何圖案處理的。圖71左手所執衣邊的衣紋處理，可看出古典的犍陀羅雕刻殘影。在敦煌，早期石窟造像就有比此有發展的造像。在北周時期（550～557年）的第428窟展示了成熟的毘盧遮那佛造像，不裸身，著衣，衣上還畫有須彌山（參照《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第1卷，圖162）。從上所述，可以考慮此木板畫最遲在6世紀就出現了。; The Department of Asia would like to thank Xanthe Carmichael for her help with updating the information on the site of Dandan-Uiliq.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
This votive plaque was found by Stein in a large cella, 5.4 m by 4.2 m, and surrounded on three sides by a circumambulatory passage 1.8 m wide, behind the square image base. Five more plaques were found along the wall. Vairocana, the supreme Buddha, is recognized by the other images appearing on his body: two seated Buddhas appear on his torso, symbols of the sun and moon on his right and left shoulders, pairs of long rectangles on each upper arm, and a bird on each forearm, besides many double circles. The long rectangles are generally taken to represent the scriptures in the form of pothi. Joanna Williams (1973) has suggested that “the significance of the books on the arms of the Cosmic Vairocana possibly lies in their identification with the Avatamsaka Sutra itself, indicating the unusual importance of the literary basis for the iconography” (p. 123; see the notes to Pl. 71).
The buildings F. Ⅱ at Farhad-beg-yailaki, of which F. Ⅱ. iii formed a part, were thought by Stein to be the living quarters of a small monastery. The coins found at the site were all wushu pieces of the Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220), with no Tang coins, and for this as well as for stylistic reasons Stein concluded that the site had been abandoned at some time between A.D. 519, when the Chinese monk Song Yun described Mocheng (identified with Charchan by Stein; see Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1255), and the end of the sixth century. This conclusion still seems to be a reasonable one: the oval shape of the head and the protruding eyes recall the three dimensional images of the Buddha from Rawak.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此木板畫是斯坦因從三面圍有1.8m寬的走廊5.4m×4.2m的大殿的方型台座背後發現的。在這裏，沿著牆壁還發現了五件木板畫。根據身上畫的各種形象，可確認本圖的像是至高無上的毘盧遮那佛，即軀幹上有兩身坐佛，兩肩上有象徵性的日月，上臂有豎的長方形，前臂上是鳥和小的同心圓。長方形一般是表示梵夾形式的佛典。Joanna Williams則認爲“毘盧遮那佛兩臂上所繪的經本，在圖像學上作爲文獻，可以認爲它就是《華嚴經》”（參照《和田佛教美術圖像》，1973年，123頁）。
斯坦因認爲，末城F. Ⅱ. iii的建築物，是這個小型寺院的生活區。此遺迹發現的貨幣都是東漢末年（25～220年）的五銖錢，沒有唐代的貨幣，從此情況及風格上的特點綜合考慮，斯坦因得出了此遺迹在中國僧人宋雲曾到過末城（斯坦因把記爲末城。參照《西域》，卷3，1255頁）的519年至6世紀末間被遺棄的結論。本圖像的橢圓形頭部和突出的眼睛等，使人想起熱瓦克佛像的立體感，斯坦因的觀點迄今爲止仍是最有說服力的。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
This plaque is almost the same size as the one bearing the story of the Silk Princess (Pl. 66), but the reverse is painted as well (though not reproduced here) with five small images of the Buddha, three of them completely effaced, the other two in purple robes, sitting within pale blue mandorlas as though in an arcade. They are similar to the rows of small Buddhas from wall painting fragments in the Khotan area.
On the front the two main figures are larger: on the left the torso of a male figure, holding a fan and looking towards an animal-headed deity, which is crowned and splendidly garbed in red and blue. The deity was identified by Stein as the Rat King: according to a legend related by Xuanzang in Da Tang xiyu ji, the king of Khotan was able to defeat an attack by the Xiongnu thanks to golden rats which gnawed the bowstrings and other gear of the latter, and which were consequently worshipped at a shrine west of Khotan. Kumagai Nobuo (1962, p. 102) notes that this plaque links folk legends with Buddhism in a special way not found among the terracottas from Khotan. Joanna Williams (1973, p. 152) considers that it is equally possible that the figure may represent a wolf head as in a votive plaque from Tarishlak (Serindia, Pl. XII) and so one of the grahas, or beings with supernatural influence over the health of children. Another votive plaque (Fig. 96), showing two women each holding a baby, must have been intended to secure protection for them, while one of the six female spirits shown in Vol. 2, Pl. 75 is a wolf-headed figure, identified in the Khotanese inscription as Mukhamanda: this deity, according to the Chinese inscription also on the painting, had to be propitiated in order to protect the child. Thus the question of identification of the middle figure must remain open. The third smaller figure has suffered some abrasion and does not help to resolve the matter.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此木板畫與《養蠶西漸傳說》的木板畫（圖66）的尺寸大致相同，但是背面也繪著五身小佛像（本書未收錄），其中三身完全消失，剩下的兩身著紫衣，坐在拱形的淡青色背光中。這些像與和田壁畫斷片中數排小千佛像相似。
正面的三像中，二身主尊的像很大。左邊的男像未完成，手持團扇，注視著頭戴寶冠、身穿赤和青衣服的獸頭像。有關此獸頭像，斯坦因根據玄奘《大唐西域記》的故事，判定爲鼠王。此故事是，大群金色的鼠咬斷匈奴的弓弦及其它的裝備，幫助于闐王擊敗匈奴人的襲擊，王在于闐的西邊爲鼠建祠堂進行祭祀。而熊谷宣夫先生（參照〈西域美術〉――《西域文化研究》第5卷，1962，102頁）認爲，此故事不見於和田出土的陶器，體現了民俗故事與佛教相結合的特殊連系。另外，Joanna Williams認爲，“此像如同Tarishlak出土的木板畫（《西域》，圖XII）可能是狼頭，或許是羯羅訶之一，或許是掌管兒童健康的神靈之一”（參照《和田佛教美術圖像》，152頁）。還有繪著兩個婦人各自抱著嬰兒的木板畫（Fig. 96），一定是在祈求兒童的安全。另外，本書第2卷圖75的六身女神像中，有一身的題記為于闐文，據Mukhamanda的解讀，就是狼頭像。而同一畫面上的漢文題記記載為保護兒童，不得不取悅該女神。因而對中間像的判斷仍是需要解決的問題。第三尊小像但由於已磨損，無助於解決問題。; The Department of Asia would like to thank Xanthe Carmichael for her help with updating the information on the site of Dandan-Uiliq.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Tucker 2003 / The Silk Road.

From Whitfield 1985:
This panel was found in the same circumstances as that in the previous plate. Although only about half as long, it is painted in a similar style on the front, and the back is painted as well (Fig. 97). This plate shows the front, with three seated figures all in the characteristic pose looking to their right. The identification of these figures has been put forward by Joanna Williams in the article already quoted in the notes to the preceding plate. She identifies the figure on the left as Indra, crowned and holding a vajra; at the other end could be Brahma, with three (out of four) heads and a third eye in each, holding a bow and arrows and a drinking bowl. The figure in the centre is suggested with less certainty by Williams as a goddess of abundance, in which case this whole group, with the Hindu gods Indra and Brahma might refer to an event such as the Buddha’s birth. The goddess holds aloft the sun and moon, as do some of the other deities in this series of votive panels from Khotan (see Pl. 70-1), and another unidentified attribute.
On the reverse (Fig. 97), two Buddhas are seated in the centre, looking towards one another, one in a red robe, the other in white, with fine drapery lines in ink. At either side sits another figure. That on the left is apparently a Bodhisattva, nude to the waist and wearing red trousers with white floral spots. The corresponding figure on the right is almost completely effaced.; Chinese

From Whitfield 1985:
This is one of the most arresting of the painted wooden plaques found by Stein at Dandan-oilik, all of which owe their fine state of preservation to the fact that they were placed above floor level. D.X at this site was a small cella with wall paintings of rows of small Buddha figures and a single stucco image, nothing of which remained, however, save the octagonal base, waisted in hourglass fashion, with a broad ledge at the bottom for offerings. The plaque was standing on end against one of the facets of the base.
The figures are depicted, as in the fragments of wall painting from Khadalik, with the main features outlined in red, and the upper eyelids and eyebrows in black. Stein recognized the subject as the legend of the introduction of sericulture to Khotan. The central figure is the Chinese princess who, according to Xuanzang (Da Tang xiyu ji, Chapter 12), warned by the envoys that there was no means of raising silkworms or mulberry leaves in Khotan, hid mulberry seeds and the eggs of the silk moth in her headdress (here indicated by the attendant on the left) and smuggled them to Khotan to raise silkworms from them, thereby circumventing the Chinese embargo on their export, which had previously frustrated the king of Khotan’s efforts to obtain the means of making silk. At the border post, the official did not dare to examine her headdress. The resulting cocoons are seen in a basket in front of the princess.
At the far right another figure stands by a loom with stretched warp, holding a beating comb in her hand, like those illustrated in Figs. 34-35. Behind her is an object that may be a reel for thread, and between her and the princess sits a presiding four-armed deity. All these identifications were made by Stein, who also noted the petal-shaped spots of dark pink set around the figures, and compared them to the auspicious sandal-ointment marks used by Hindus. In addition the four-armed god has been identified by N. V.D’ yakonova as a patron of weaving, presiding over the Silk Legend, as on this panel, and occasionally represented separately, as in Pl. 70-2 and another panel in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad (Joanna Williams, 1973, Fig. 63). Still another panel on exhibition in the Hermitage Museum (ibid., Fig. 64) presents the same figures in a vertical composition, with the four-armed god at the top of the panel and below him the princess holding the bowl of cocoons, with a kneeling attendant holding a shuttle (?). Below that, the princess is shown once more, this time with an attendant pointing at her headdress, just as in the Stein panel reproduced here.
Yet another panel brought by Stein from Dandan-oilik, and now in New Delhi (ibid., Fig. 58, and Ancient Khotan, Pl. LXVII), displays a slightly different version of the same subject, which can be seen as an important local legend, of which the panel shown here was the first and is still the finest example.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
斯坦因在丹丹烏里克發現的木板畫中，此繪畫是最爲引人注目的作品，由於是放在地板上，保存狀態極好。發現它的丹丹烏里克D.X寺址，是一個有數層千佛壁畫以及一身塑像的小屋。現在塑像已沒有了，只剩下中間細的漏斗狀八角形台座，下面曾有放供物的寬架子，此木板畫正好靠放在台座的一面。
臉部與喀達里克壁畫的斷片一樣，主要輪廓線用紅色描繪，上瞼和眉毛上加了墨色。斯坦因認爲，此主題與養蠶技術傳到于闐的傳說故事有關。主要人物是中國公主，據玄奘的《大唐西域記》（12章）記載，于闐過去沒有桑葉，也沒有蠶，于闐王命令使者去求得桑葉和蠶，但中國禁止帶出國外。於是，她便將桑種和繭藏在頭飾中（左邊的侍女正在指著），嫁到于闐。國境的關卡不可能查到頭飾，計劃順利成功。從此于闐開始養蠶，公主前面的籃子裏盛滿了繭。
站在撐滿經線的織機旁右端的像，右手拿著與Figs. 34-35展示的相同的筬。她後邊放著紡車樣的器械，她和公主中間坐著四臂神像。斯坦因對以上進行過比定，也進一步對散落于諸像周邊的暗紅色花瓣形裝飾，和印度教的塗白檀香的吉祥標誌做了比較。另外，N. V.D’ yakonova將四臂神像與掌管養蠶的編織守護神作了比定，圖70－2和艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的另外的一塊木板畫（參照Joanna Williams《和田佛教美術圖像》，Fig. 63），是作爲獨立像描繪的。而陳列于艾爾米塔什美術館的有另外一塊木板畫，內容是縱向排列的（同上，參照Fig. 64），最上部繪著四臂像，其下是手持盛繭容器的公主和手捧梭樣器械跪著的侍女，最下段描繪的公主和指向其頭飾的侍女的樣子，與本圖木板畫中的一樣。
同樣，斯坦因從丹丹烏里克所獲現藏新德里國立博物館一塊木板畫（同上，參照Fig. 58及《古代和田》圖版LXVII）也繪有相同主題，但其表現形式略有变化，可以視爲當地的一個重要傳説。此木板畫較本圖所示的年代早，而且更爲精美。; The Department of Asia would like to thank Xanthe Carmichael for her help with updating the information on the site of Dandan-Uiliq.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
The first three of these fragments are all from a large square shrine at Khadalik from which Stein recovered many manuscripts and fragments of wall painting (the largest section of painted wall with stencilled Buddhas from the cella of this shrine is shown among the text figures to the Introduction of Vol. 1). The fourth piece is also from Khadalik, but its exact position on the site is not known. The site was abandoned towards the end of the eighth century, as established by Stein from finds of coins at the site (see Serindia, Vol. I, p. 159).
Although the figure of Ganesa is somewhat coarsely drawn, the other figures are finely delineated. The head of the Buddha in particular may be compared to a larger fragment (see Serindia, Pl. XI, Kha. i. C. 0097) from the centre of the shrine. Although this larger fragment, which is still in the British Museum, has suffered considerably since its reproduction by Stein, the plate in Serindia shows both the splendour of the original composition and the way in which it was related to small seated figures of the Buddha, alternating in background colour. The Buddha is seated with hands in the teaching mudra; his lotus throne has two rows of fleshy petals, symmetrically disposed. Behind him is a mandorla of stylized flames. On either side stand tall Bodhisattvas, swaying at the waist slightly towards the Buddha, the legs very stiff and straight. Their form is close to that of the individual Bodhisattvas of Vol. 1, Pls. 46-48, and the stance recurs much later in most of the paintings found by Kozlov at Kharakhoto and now in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad (cf. Dieux et demons de l’ Himalaya, Nos.22-23, p. 77ff). Small seated Buddhas, all with their heads slightly inclined in three-quarters view, surround the whole composition, which thus appears as a Buddha triad on a ground of regularly alternating smaller figures, on a smaller scale but with the same organization as that to be found in the Sui and Tang caves at Dunhuang. Joanna Williams (1973,p. 110) has pointed out how important this fragment is, since it “connects a variety of types of image which are usually preserved only in fragments.”
Another sizeable fragment, Kha. i. E. 0058. c, unfortunately not reproduced here or in Serindia, has four of the small Buddhas with colours well preserved: white and red alternate in the mandorlas and ground, with occasional nimbi or mandorlas of purplish pink, while the Buddha’s robe may be red, black brown or white. Each is seated on a flat-topped padmasana with down-turned petals. The main facial features are outlined in red, but the pupils, upper eyelids and eyebrows are in ink. The two small fragments shown in Fig. 42 are of this type. (Figure 49, though a wooden plaque and not a wall painting, shows the correct angle at which the head was inclined; a single larger head, Kha. i. 0054,is reproduced in Serindia, Pl. XI.) The few drapery lines are in ink and occasionally accented in white, but on the whole the painters seem to have preferred the use of areas of colour without outline, so that the figures have a simple solidity. No lines are ruled between the Buddhas, the frame for each being established by the simple counterchange of colours in the ground.
Among the other fragments shown in the monochrome figures, Fig. 44 displays brilliant colours: the bodhisattva, presumably Avalokitesvara since he holds a flask, wears azure trousers; his body, outlined in red, is pink against a bright green mandorla with broad brown and red borders. The small figure nearby appears to be a donor. Plate 53-4 shows some of the same blue, less brilliant in reproduction than in the original, combined with delicate outlines and subtle green and pink shades, in a fragment of the Cosmic Vairocana with the sun disc on his shoulder and a vajra on the forearm (cf. Pl. 72 and Figs. 50, 95). Such pieces afford a mere glimpse of the wealth and quality of Khotanese painting, and it is interesting that one fragment (Fig. 43) shows a hand grasping a writing brush: the handle is of wood, with a close binding and slightly swelling bundle of hairs at the end.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
前三件都是從喀達里克的大方形寺址攜來的斷片，斯坦因從那裏還發現了許多文書類和壁畫斷片（寺院内殿用模板繪的千佛壁畫，刊載於本書第1卷的《導言》部分的插圖中）。第四張斷片也是從喀達里克發現的，但不知是否在這個寺址出土的。斯坦因據在此地發現的硬幣推斷，此遺迹可能是8世紀結束時廢棄的（參照《西域》159頁）。
智慧神像有幾分粗劣，其他諸像描繪的相當精細。特別是佛頭可與該寺址中央位置發現的大斷片（參照《西域》圖版XI， Kha.l.C.0097）相比較。斯坦因將大斷片收錄在《西域》的圖版內，當時看來破損嚴重，故本書未收錄。看《西域》圖版，就會發現當初極壯觀的構圖，以及有規則地配置小佛坐像、背景顔色變換等技法。中尊佛兩手結說法印，結跏趺坐在蓮華座上，蓮花座由兩層豐滿蓮瓣對稱排列而成，背後是模式化曼陀羅火焰紋的背光。左右有長身的菩薩，腰略傾向佛立著，其腿筆直僵硬。此菩薩的姿態，與本書第1卷圖46-48的諸菩薩像，以及科茲洛夫發現于黑水城現存於艾爾米塔什美術館，時代稍晚的繪畫（參照《喜瑪拉亞的神與魔》，圖22、23，頁77）中所見的相似。
這些主尊群的周圍，配有略向前傾的小佛坐像，這看來恰似佛三尊突出在有規則地分配小佛像的背景中。此小佛群，規模雖小，但讓人想起敦煌隋唐窟中所見千佛的結構。Joanna Williams也指出，此斷片的重要性，就在於各個零七八碎很難拼合的斷片上，能看出像與像間的相互關係（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973，110頁）。
此外，《西域》中沒有收錄，遺憾的是本書選材時也遺漏了的，還有色彩保存較好的四身小佛的略大些的斷片Kha.i.E.0058.c。那斷片上，身光和底色交替搭配著白和紅色，紅色時而在頭光上，時而又用在身光上。而佛的衣服爲紅、黑、茶、白等色，都坐在平坦的覆瓣蓮花座上。臉部的主要部分用朱線描繪，瞼和眉毛使用了黑色。Fig. 42展示的兩塊斷片與此是同類作品（收錄於《西域》圖版XI的繪有佛頭的斷片Kha.i.0054，也是與此同類的作品。另外，本書Fig. 49，雖然是板繪而不是壁畫，但前側向的臉部表現與此相同）。衣紋線使用黑色，偶爾用白色來突出，大概是畫家比較喜歡省略輪廓線而以色面來表現，佛像具有一點立體感。各小佛坐像間沒有分界線，只是調換每個像框的底色來體現。

From Whitfield 1985:
The first three of these fragments are all from a large square shrine at Khadalik from which Stein recovered many manuscripts and fragments of wall painting (the largest section of painted wall with stencilled Buddhas from the cella of this shrine is shown among the text figures to the Introduction of Vol. 1). The fourth piece is also from Khadalik, but its exact position on the site is not known. The site was abandoned towards the end of the eighth century, as established by Stein from finds of coins at the site (see Serindia, Vol. I, p. 159).
Although the figure of Ganesa is somewhat coarsely drawn, the other figures are finely delineated. The head of the Buddha in particular may be compared to a larger fragment (see Serindia, Pl. XI, Kha. i. C. 0097) from the centre of the shrine. Although this larger fragment, which is still in the British Museum, has suffered considerably since its reproduction by Stein, the plate in Serindia shows both the splendour of the original composition and the way in which it was related to small seated figures of the Buddha, alternating in background colour. The Buddha is seated with hands in the teaching mudra; his lotus throne has two rows of fleshy petals, symmetrically disposed. Behind him is a mandorla of stylized flames. On either side stand tall Bodhisattvas, swaying at the waist slightly towards the Buddha, the legs very stiff and straight. Their form is close to that of the individual Bodhisattvas of Vol. 1, Pls. 46-48, and the stance recurs much later in most of the paintings found by Kozlov at Kharakhoto and now in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad (cf. Dieux et demons de l’ Himalaya, Nos.22-23, p. 77ff). Small seated Buddhas, all with their heads slightly inclined in three-quarters view, surround the whole composition, which thus appears as a Buddha triad on a ground of regularly alternating smaller figures, on a smaller scale but with the same organization as that to be found in the Sui and Tang caves at Dunhuang. Joanna Williams (1973,p. 110) has pointed out how important this fragment is, since it “connects a variety of types of image which are usually preserved only in fragments.”
Another sizeable fragment, Kha. i. E. 0058. c, unfortunately not reproduced here or in Serindia, has four of the small Buddhas with colours well preserved: white and red alternate in the mandorlas and ground, with occasional nimbi or mandorlas of purplish pink, while the Buddha’s robe may be red, black brown or white. Each is seated on a flat-topped padmasana with down-turned petals. The main facial features are outlined in red, but the pupils, upper eyelids and eyebrows are in ink. The two small fragments shown in Fig. 42 are of this type. (Figure 49, though a wooden plaque and not a wall painting, shows the correct angle at which the head was inclined; a single larger head, Kha. i. 0054,is reproduced in Serindia, Pl. XI.) The few drapery lines are in ink and occasionally accented in white, but on the whole the painters seem to have preferred the use of areas of colour without outline, so that the figures have a simple solidity. No lines are ruled between the Buddhas, the frame for each being established by the simple counterchange of colours in the ground.
Among the other fragments shown in the monochrome figures, Fig. 44 displays brilliant colours: the bodhisattva, presumably Avalokitesvara since he holds a flask, wears azure trousers; his body, outlined in red, is pink against a bright green mandorla with broad brown and red borders. The small figure nearby appears to be a donor. Plate 53-4 shows some of the same blue, less brilliant in reproduction than in the original, combined with delicate outlines and subtle green and pink shades, in a fragment of the Cosmic Vairocana with the sun disc on his shoulder and a vajra on the forearm (cf. Pl. 72 and Figs. 50, 95). Such pieces afford a mere glimpse of the wealth and quality of Khotanese painting, and it is interesting that one fragment (Fig. 43) shows a hand grasping a writing brush: the handle is of wood, with a close binding and slightly swelling bundle of hairs at the end.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
前三件都是從喀達里克的大方形寺址攜來的斷片，斯坦因從那裏還發現了許多文書類和壁畫斷片（寺院内殿用模板繪的千佛壁畫，刊載於本書第1卷的《導言》部分的插圖中）。第四張斷片也是從喀達里克發現的，但不知是否在這個寺址出土的。斯坦因據在此地發現的硬幣推斷，此遺迹可能是8世紀結束時廢棄的（參照《西域》159頁）。
智慧神像有幾分粗劣，其他諸像描繪的相當精細。特別是佛頭可與該寺址中央位置發現的大斷片（參照《西域》圖版XI， Kha.l.C.0097）相比較。斯坦因將大斷片收錄在《西域》的圖版內，當時看來破損嚴重，故本書未收錄。看《西域》圖版，就會發現當初極壯觀的構圖，以及有規則地配置小佛坐像、背景顔色變換等技法。中尊佛兩手結說法印，結跏趺坐在蓮華座上，蓮花座由兩層豐滿蓮瓣對稱排列而成，背後是模式化曼陀羅火焰紋的背光。左右有長身的菩薩，腰略傾向佛立著，其腿筆直僵硬。此菩薩的姿態，與本書第1卷圖46-48的諸菩薩像，以及科茲洛夫發現于黑水城現存於艾爾米塔什美術館，時代稍晚的繪畫（參照《喜瑪拉亞的神與魔》，圖22、23，頁77）中所見的相似。
這些主尊群的周圍，配有略向前傾的小佛坐像，這看來恰似佛三尊突出在有規則地分配小佛像的背景中。此小佛群，規模雖小，但讓人想起敦煌隋唐窟中所見千佛的結構。Joanna Williams也指出，此斷片的重要性，就在於各個零七八碎很難拼合的斷片上，能看出像與像間的相互關係（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973，110頁）。
此外，《西域》中沒有收錄，遺憾的是本書選材時也遺漏了的，還有色彩保存較好的四身小佛的略大些的斷片Kha.i.E.0058.c。那斷片上，身光和底色交替搭配著白和紅色，紅色時而在頭光上，時而又用在身光上。而佛的衣服爲紅、黑、茶、白等色，都坐在平坦的覆瓣蓮花座上。臉部的主要部分用朱線描繪，瞼和眉毛使用了黑色。Fig. 42展示的兩塊斷片與此是同類作品（收錄於《西域》圖版XI的繪有佛頭的斷片Kha.i.0054，也是與此同類的作品。另外，本書Fig. 49，雖然是板繪而不是壁畫，但前側向的臉部表現與此相同）。衣紋線使用黑色，偶爾用白色來突出，大概是畫家比較喜歡省略輪廓線而以色面來表現，佛像具有一點立體感。各小佛坐像間沒有分界線，只是調換每個像框的底色來體現。

From Whitfield 1985:
The site at Shorchuk, to which Stein gave the local name, Ming-oi (“Thousand Dwellings”), lies on a ridge to the north of the village, some sixty kilometers south of Karashahr. In antiquity all of the many shrines, with the exception of a series of caves, had been destroyed by fire, and had largely collapsed inwards. The fire, as well as being destructive, had a preservative effect upon parts of the stucco ornament of the shrines, especially in the case of the heads of many figures, which had been made with greater care and attention than the limbs and bodies. By and large, wall paintings did not survive, with the exception of fragments from one shrine. Apart from small fragments, the pieces shown here and in the following plates are the only items of wall painting from the Stein Collection now in the British Museum; the rest are all in New Delhi.
    The fragments come from a temple in the northwestern part of the site, the only recognizable part of a complex of halls and rooms. When examined by Stein, he thought that the entrance hall had in fact already been partially cleared. However, although Grunwedel had earlier visited the site in Jone 1906 (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 191ff), Oldenburg was later to recover more paintings from this same entrance hall (see below). Beyond the entrance hall was a cella five metres square, the entrance of which had once been flanked by a statue on each side. The cella itself was filled with burnt brickwork; on its east and west sides vaulted passages led to a narrow chamber, also vaulted, behind the cella. It was in this narrow vaulted chamber, designated xiii by Stein, that the paintings shown here were found. They formed a continuous dado along the foot of the outer wall for about three and a half metres in the eastern half of the chamber. Stein also recovered one panel (Mi. xiii. 10) from the western passage, which had been blocked by debris before the fire. This panel is also in the British Museum, but the surface has deteriorated since it was reproduced in Serindia (Pl. CXXIV).
    The series of panels begins with scenes of monks receiving instruction. The senior monks, some of them clearly aged (Pl. 95-2), are seated on square stools, some with closed-in sides, others open showing the legs and stretchers, and incorporating a foot-rest. Their pupils, on the other hand, kneel in front of them. In the first scene (Pl. 95-1), both master and pupils are writing on tablets, which have the long narrow shape of pothi leaves. In the sky above, a descending apsaras brings a writing brush, in an interesting variation on the more usual theme of scattering flowers (Pl. 95-2). In another scene, the figure descending on clouds from above appears from his dress to be a Buddha; below him two groups of monks and devatas kneel in adoration (Pl. 95-4). Another scene, only partially preserved, shows a monk prostrating himself in front of his master, in a gesture reminiscent of the Vow before Dipankara (Pl. 95-8; cf. Pl. 117).
    Despite the colourfulness of this series of panels, they are easily outshone by the two larger panels recovered from the same shrine by Oldenburg, which are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. They are reproduced in colour in his report (Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. IX, X). One of them shows a lady of high rank, apparently in great grief, as she raises her hand to her face. Nearby kneels a small boy in typical Uighur costume. They are both just behind a very much larger figure of the Buddha. The other panel, which must have been on the other side of the doorway in the main hall of the shrine, shows two Bodhisattvas and a number of monks, some of them kneeling. Both paintings are very finely drawn and lavishly coloured, and gold is used quite extensively. By comparison, the Stein panels, occupying a relatively humble and obscure position low on the rear wall of the rear chamber of the shrine, are correspondingly muted in both colouring and subject matter. They are, however, extremely important since the landscape settings still preserve elements that must derive from the art of the Kizil caves. Each of the monks seated and transcribing texts is placed in a niche or cave within a hill whose contours rise in a series of rounded steps, outlined in ink (Pls. 95-10, 11). The hills are lined up one beside the other, and a second row is seen above them. It is principally the stepped contour of the hills that recalls the ceilings of many of the Kizil caves, where jataka stories are illustrated in a landscape setting of stylized hills, repeated over the whole roof vault. Although the arrangement in the Ming-oi panels is not continuous so as to fill the whole space, there are other similarities as well, namely the occasional tree or animal seen around the edges or the hills (Pl. 95-11). Thus while the costume and hair fashion of the small kneeling boy (Pl. 95-6) is clear evidence of the Uighur dating of these paintings, at the latest they are eighth or ninth century.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
斯坦因採用當地語言“明屋（千家）”命名的此遺址，在焉耆向南約60公里處，散佈在碩爾楚克北面的山地裏。除石窟外，許多寺院在古代都曾遭受過火災，向里倒塌。當然，火災有帶來破壞的一面，但也有有利的一面，寺院用灰泥裝飾部分，特別是佛像頭部，它比軀體、手腳製作的更認真，燃燒使之變得更結實，起到了保護的效果。除了一個寺院的一個壁畫殘片外，壁畫幾乎都沒有留下。另外，斯坦因收集的壁畫，藏在大英博物館的，除了極小的斷片外，大概只有本圖所展示的作品了，其它都收藏在新德里。
本圖的壁畫是在位于遺迹西北部只剩大廳和幾閒屋的佛寺中發現的。斯坦因認爲，在自己開始考察之前，入口的大廳曾有人涉足。而格倫威德爾訪問此地是1906年6月（參照Grunwedel：Alt-Buddhistische Kultstutten in Chinesische-Turkistan 1912,191頁），後奧登堡從此入口的大廳發現了另一壁畫（見下）。入口的大廳深處有5米見方的正方形内殿，其門兩側似乎有過塑像。佛堂本身被燒塌的瓦礫埋沒，其東西兩端是帶拱形天井的側廊，通向同樣有拱形天井的佛堂背後狹小的內室。本圖展示的壁畫是，從斯坦因命名爲xiii的此有拱形天井的狹小內室發現的。壁畫是內室外壁東側一半約3.5米長的牆圍子。斯坦因還從火災之前就被堆積層堵塞的西邊側廊發現了一面壁畫（Mi.xiii.10）。那壁畫也收藏于大英博物館，其畫面狀態比當時《西域》（參照圖CXXI V）中展示時的還要惡化。
壁畫首先從多個比丘聽授教法的場景開始。年長的比丘腰倚方形的凳子，能明顯能看出年齡（第95－2圖）等，有的腳被斜向橫過的裝飾遮隱，而大多數連放腳或腿的臺子都被描繪出來。另一面，弟子們在前面屈膝而坐。第一場景（第95－3圖）中，無論師父還是弟子都在細長的菩提葉上寫字。上空繪著散花的飛天手持毛筆（圖95－2）。而在另一場景中，從上空乘雲飛來的像是偏袒右肩的佛，其下有兩組比丘和天部在合掌贊頌（圖95－4）。另一場景只保存了一部分，可辨出師父前匍匐的虔誠比丘的身姿（圖95－5）。此景象，使人想起布髮本生的場面（參照圖117）。
此連環壁畫儘管色彩豐富，但遠不及奧登堡從同一佛寺發現現存于艾爾米塔什美術館的兩幅大壁畫。在其報告中刊載了那兩幅壁畫的彩色圖版（參照Oldenburg，Russkays Turkestanskaya Ekspedit-siya.Goda,1909~1910,1914,圖版IX,X）。其中一面上，有手貼在臉，沈浸於深深地悲哀中的貴族女性，旁邊跪著穿典型回鶻裝的少年，兩人的背後立著極大的佛像。另一面壁畫無疑與主室門口的其它壁畫不同，那裏描繪的是兩身菩薩和數身比丘，有幾個比丘是跪姿。兩面都是精致的描繪，使用了華麗的色彩，還加了大量的金彩。
相比之下，斯坦因的壁畫也許是描繪在內室內壁下部這一既不重要也不顯眼的場所，色彩和主題都稍差。但在此壁畫可以看出克孜爾石窟壁畫風格的山水描繪，這一點很重要。比丘各自坐在山中的石窟或佛龕中抄寫經文。山的輪廓用墨繪成圓頭的臺階狀(圖 95-10, 11)。那山排成一列，其上方可見第二列。臺階狀的山的輪廓使人想起克孜爾石窟的多數天井畫。克孜爾石窟裏，半球形的整面天井上，描繪著以模式化的山水爲背景的本生圖。明屋壁畫上的山水雖然不是連续遮掩整面，但還能見到其他類似點，就是那些山上隨處可見的樹和動物等（圖95－11）的描繪。跪拜的少年（圖95－8）的衣服和髮型也能够證明此連環的壁畫是回鶻時期的，其年代最遲不過8～9世紀。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
The site at Shorchuk, to which Stein gave the local name, Ming-oi (“Thousand Dwellings”), lies on a ridge to the north of the village, some sixty kilometers south of Karashahr. In antiquity all of the many shrines, with the exception of a series of caves, had been destroyed by fire, and had largely collapsed inwards. The fire, as well as being destructive, had a preservative effect upon parts of the stucco ornament of the shrines, especially in the case of the heads of many figures, which had been made with greater care and attention than the limbs and bodies. By and large, wall paintings did not survive, with the exception of fragments from one shrine. Apart from small fragments, the pieces shown here and in the following plates are the only items of wall painting from the Stein Collection now in the British Museum; the rest are all in New Delhi.
    The fragments come from a temple in the northwestern part of the site, the only recognizable part of a complex of halls and rooms. When examined by Stein, he thought that the entrance hall had in fact already been partially cleared. However, although Grunwedel had earlier visited the site in Jone 1906 (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 191ff), Oldenburg was later to recover more paintings from this same entrance hall (see below). Beyond the entrance hall was a cella five metres square, the entrance of which had once been flanked by a statue on each side. The cella itself was filled with burnt brickwork; on its east and west sides vaulted passages led to a narrow chamber, also vaulted, behind the cella. It was in this narrow vaulted chamber, designated xiii by Stein, that the paintings shown here were found. They formed a continuous dado along the foot of the outer wall for about three and a half metres in the eastern half of the chamber. Stein also recovered one panel (Mi. xiii. 10) from the western passage, which had been blocked by debris before the fire. This panel is also in the British Museum, but the surface has deteriorated since it was reproduced in Serindia (Pl. CXXIV).
    The series of panels begins with scenes of monks receiving instruction. The senior monks, some of them clearly aged (Pl. 95-2), are seated on square stools, some with closed-in sides, others open showing the legs and stretchers, and incorporating a foot-rest. Their pupils, on the other hand, kneel in front of them. In the first scene (Pl. 95-1), both master and pupils are writing on tablets, which have the long narrow shape of pothi leaves. In the sky above, a descending apsaras brings a writing brush, in an interesting variation on the more usual theme of scattering flowers (Pl. 95-2). In another scene, the figure descending on clouds from above appears from his dress to be a Buddha; below him two groups of monks and devatas kneel in adoration (Pl. 95-4). Another scene, only partially preserved, shows a monk prostrating himself in front of his master, in a gesture reminiscent of the Vow before Dipankara (Pl. 95-8; cf. Pl. 117).
    Despite the colourfulness of this series of panels, they are easily outshone by the two larger panels recovered from the same shrine by Oldenburg, which are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. They are reproduced in colour in his report (Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. IX, X). One of them shows a lady of high rank, apparently in great grief, as she raises her hand to her face. Nearby kneels a small boy in typical Uighur costume. They are both just behind a very much larger figure of the Buddha. The other panel, which must have been on the other side of the doorway in the main hall of the shrine, shows two Bodhisattvas and a number of monks, some of them kneeling. Both paintings are very finely drawn and lavishly coloured, and gold is used quite extensively. By comparison, the Stein panels, occupying a relatively humble and obscure position low on the rear wall of the rear chamber of the shrine, are correspondingly muted in both colouring and subject matter. They are, however, extremely important since the landscape settings still preserve elements that must derive from the art of the Kizil caves. Each of the monks seated and transcribing texts is placed in a niche or cave within a hill whose contours rise in a series of rounded steps, outlined in ink (Pls. 95-10, 11). The hills are lined up one beside the other, and a second row is seen above them. It is principally the stepped contour of the hills that recalls the ceilings of many of the Kizil caves, where jataka stories are illustrated in a landscape setting of stylized hills, repeated over the whole roof vault. Although the arrangement in the Ming-oi panels is not continuous so as to fill the whole space, there are other similarities as well, namely the occasional tree or animal seen around the edges or the hills (Pl. 95-11). Thus while the costume and hair fashion of the small kneeling boy (Pl. 95-6) is clear evidence of the Uighur dating of these paintings, at the latest they are eighth or ninth century.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
斯坦因採用當地語言“明屋（千家）”命名的此遺址，在焉耆向南約60公里處，散佈在碩爾楚克北面的山地裏。除石窟外，許多寺院在古代都曾遭受過火災，向里倒塌。當然，火災有帶來破壞的一面，但也有有利的一面，寺院用灰泥裝飾部分，特別是佛像頭部，它比軀體、手腳製作的更認真，燃燒使之變得更結實，起到了保護的效果。除了一個寺院的一個壁畫殘片外，壁畫幾乎都沒有留下。另外，斯坦因收集的壁畫，藏在大英博物館的，除了極小的斷片外，大概只有本圖所展示的作品了，其它都收藏在新德里。
本圖的壁畫是在位于遺迹西北部只剩大廳和幾閒屋的佛寺中發現的。斯坦因認爲，在自己開始考察之前，入口的大廳曾有人涉足。而格倫威德爾訪問此地是1906年6月（參照Grunwedel：Alt-Buddhistische Kultstutten in Chinesische-Turkistan 1912,191頁），後奧登堡從此入口的大廳發現了另一壁畫（見下）。入口的大廳深處有5米見方的正方形内殿，其門兩側似乎有過塑像。佛堂本身被燒塌的瓦礫埋沒，其東西兩端是帶拱形天井的側廊，通向同樣有拱形天井的佛堂背後狹小的內室。本圖展示的壁畫是，從斯坦因命名爲xiii的此有拱形天井的狹小內室發現的。壁畫是內室外壁東側一半約3.5米長的牆圍子。斯坦因還從火災之前就被堆積層堵塞的西邊側廊發現了一面壁畫（Mi.xiii.10）。那壁畫也收藏于大英博物館，其畫面狀態比當時《西域》（參照圖CXXI V）中展示時的還要惡化。
壁畫首先從多個比丘聽授教法的場景開始。年長的比丘腰倚方形的凳子，能明顯能看出年齡（第95－2圖）等，有的腳被斜向橫過的裝飾遮隱，而大多數連放腳或腿的臺子都被描繪出來。另一面，弟子們在前面屈膝而坐。第一場景（第95－3圖）中，無論師父還是弟子都在細長的菩提葉上寫字。上空繪著散花的飛天手持毛筆（圖95－2）。而在另一場景中，從上空乘雲飛來的像是偏袒右肩的佛，其下有兩組比丘和天部在合掌贊頌（圖95－4）。另一場景只保存了一部分，可辨出師父前匍匐的虔誠比丘的身姿（圖95－5）。此景象，使人想起布髮本生的場面（參照圖117）。
此連環壁畫儘管色彩豐富，但遠不及奧登堡從同一佛寺發現現存于艾爾米塔什美術館的兩幅大壁畫。在其報告中刊載了那兩幅壁畫的彩色圖版（參照Oldenburg，Russkays Turkestanskaya Ekspedit-siya.Goda,1909~1910,1914,圖版IX,X）。其中一面上，有手貼在臉，沈浸於深深地悲哀中的貴族女性，旁邊跪著穿典型回鶻裝的少年，兩人的背後立著極大的佛像。另一面壁畫無疑與主室門口的其它壁畫不同，那裏描繪的是兩身菩薩和數身比丘，有幾個比丘是跪姿。兩面都是精致的描繪，使用了華麗的色彩，還加了大量的金彩。
相比之下，斯坦因的壁畫也許是描繪在內室內壁下部這一既不重要也不顯眼的場所，色彩和主題都稍差。但在此壁畫可以看出克孜爾石窟壁畫風格的山水描繪，這一點很重要。比丘各自坐在山中的石窟或佛龕中抄寫經文。山的輪廓用墨繪成圓頭的臺階狀(圖 95-10, 11)。那山排成一列，其上方可見第二列。臺階狀的山的輪廓使人想起克孜爾石窟的多數天井畫。克孜爾石窟裏，半球形的整面天井上，描繪著以模式化的山水爲背景的本生圖。明屋壁畫上的山水雖然不是連续遮掩整面，但還能見到其他類似點，就是那些山上隨處可見的樹和動物等（圖95－11）的描繪。跪拜的少年（圖95－8）的衣服和髮型也能够證明此連環的壁畫是回鶻時期的，其年代最遲不過8～9世紀。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

此連環壁畫儘管色彩豐富，但遠不及奧登堡從同一佛寺發現現存于艾爾米塔什美術館的兩幅大壁畫。在其報告中刊載了那兩幅壁畫的彩色圖版（參照Oldenburg，Russkays Turkestanskaya Ekspedit-siya.Goda,1909~1910,1914,圖版IX,X）。其中一面上，有手貼在臉，沈浸於深深地悲哀中的貴族女性，旁邊跪著穿典型回鶻裝的少年，兩人的背後立著極大的佛像。另一面壁畫無疑與主室門口的其它壁畫不同，那裏描繪的是兩身菩薩和數身比丘，有幾個比丘是跪姿。兩面都是精致的描繪，使用了華麗的色彩，還加了大量的金彩。
相比之下，斯坦因的壁畫也許是描繪在內室內壁下部這一既不重要也不顯眼的場所，色彩和主題都稍差。但在此壁畫可以看出克孜爾石窟壁畫風格的山水描繪，這一點很重要。比丘各自坐在山中的石窟或佛龕中抄寫經文。山的輪廓用墨繪成圓頭的臺階狀(圖 95-10, 11)。那山排成一列，其上方可見第二列。臺階狀的山的輪廓使人想起克孜爾石窟的多數天井畫。克孜爾石窟裏，半球形的整面天井上，描繪著以模式化的山水爲背景的本生圖。明屋壁畫上的山水雖然不是連续遮掩整面，但還能見到其他類似點，就是那些山上隨處可見的樹和動物等（圖95－11）的描繪。跪拜的少年（圖95－8）的衣服和髮型也能够證明此連環的壁畫是回鶻時期的，其年代最遲不過8～9世紀。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
The site at Shorchuk, to which Stein gave the local name, Ming-oi (“Thousand Dwellings”), lies on a ridge to the north of the village, some sixty kilometers south of Karashahr. In antiquity all of the many shrines, with the exception of a series of caves, had been destroyed by fire, and had largely collapsed inwards. The fire, as well as being destructive, had a preservative effect upon parts of the stucco ornament of the shrines, especially in the case of the heads of many figures, which had been made with greater care and attention than the limbs and bodies. By and large, wall paintings did not survive, with the exception of fragments from one shrine. Apart from small fragments, the pieces shown here and in the following plates are the only items of wall painting from the Stein Collection now in the British Museum; the rest are all in New Delhi.
    The fragments come from a temple in the northwestern part of the site, the only recognizable part of a complex of halls and rooms. When examined by Stein, he thought that the entrance hall had in fact already been partially cleared. However, although Grunwedel had earlier visited the site in Jone 1906 (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 191ff), Oldenburg was later to recover more paintings from this same entrance hall (see below). Beyond the entrance hall was a cella five metres square, the entrance of which had once been flanked by a statue on each side. The cella itself was filled with burnt brickwork; on its east and west sides vaulted passages led to a narrow chamber, also vaulted, behind the cella. It was in this narrow vaulted chamber, designated xiii by Stein, that the paintings shown here were found. They formed a continuous dado along the foot of the outer wall for about three and a half metres in the eastern half of the chamber. Stein also recovered one panel (Mi. xiii. 10) from the western passage, which had been blocked by debris before the fire. This panel is also in the British Museum, but the surface has deteriorated since it was reproduced in Serindia (Pl. CXXIV).
    The series of panels begins with scenes of monks receiving instruction. The senior monks, some of them clearly aged (Pl. 95-2), are seated on square stools, some with closed-in sides, others open showing the legs and stretchers, and incorporating a foot-rest. Their pupils, on the other hand, kneel in front of them. In the first scene (Pl. 95-1), both master and pupils are writing on tablets, which have the long narrow shape of pothi leaves. In the sky above, a descending apsaras brings a writing brush, in an interesting variation on the more usual theme of scattering flowers (Pl. 95-2). In another scene, the figure descending on clouds from above appears from his dress to be a Buddha; below him two groups of monks and devatas kneel in adoration (Pl. 95-4). Another scene, only partially preserved, shows a monk prostrating himself in front of his master, in a gesture reminiscent of the Vow before Dipankara (Pl. 95-8; cf. Pl. 117).
    Despite the colourfulness of this series of panels, they are easily outshone by the two larger panels recovered from the same shrine by Oldenburg, which are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. They are reproduced in colour in his report (Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. IX, X). One of them shows a lady of high rank, apparently in great grief, as she raises her hand to her face. Nearby kneels a small boy in typical Uighur costume. They are both just behind a very much larger figure of the Buddha. The other panel, which must have been on the other side of the doorway in the main hall of the shrine, shows two Bodhisattvas and a number of monks, some of them kneeling. Both paintings are very finely drawn and lavishly coloured, and gold is used quite extensively. By comparison, the Stein panels, occupying a relatively humble and obscure position low on the rear wall of the rear chamber of the shrine, are correspondingly muted in both colouring and subject matter. They are, however, extremely important since the landscape settings still preserve elements that must derive from the art of the Kizil caves. Each of the monks seated and transcribing texts is placed in a niche or cave within a hill whose contours rise in a series of rounded steps, outlined in ink (Pls. 95-10, 11). The hills are lined up one beside the other, and a second row is seen above them. It is principally the stepped contour of the hills that recalls the ceilings of many of the Kizil caves, where jataka stories are illustrated in a landscape setting of stylized hills, repeated over the whole roof vault. Although the arrangement in the Ming-oi panels is not continuous so as to fill the whole space, there are other similarities as well, namely the occasional tree or animal seen around the edges or the hills (Pl. 95-11). Thus while the costume and hair fashion of the small kneeling boy (Pl. 95-6) is clear evidence of the Uighur dating of these paintings, at the latest they are eighth or ninth century.; Chinese

斯坦因採用當地語言“明屋（千家）”命名的此遺址，在焉耆向南約60公里處，散佈在碩爾楚克北面的山地裏。除石窟外，許多寺院在古代都曾遭受過火災，向里倒塌。當然，火災有帶來破壞的一面，但也有有利的一面，寺院用灰泥裝飾部分，特別是佛像頭部，它比軀體、手腳製作的更認真，燃燒使之變得更結實，起到了保護的效果。除了一個寺院的一個壁畫殘片外，壁畫幾乎都沒有留下。另外，斯坦因收集的壁畫，藏在大英博物館的，除了極小的斷片外，大概只有本圖所展示的作品了，其它都收藏在新德里。
本圖的壁畫是在位于遺迹西北部只剩大廳和幾閒屋的佛寺中發現的。斯坦因認爲，在自己開始考察之前，入口的大廳曾有人涉足。而格倫威德爾訪問此地是1906年6月（參照Grunwedel：Alt-Buddhistische Kultstutten in Chinesische-Turkistan 1912,191頁），後奧登堡從此入口的大廳發現了另一壁畫（見下）。入口的大廳深處有5米見方的正方形内殿，其門兩側似乎有過塑像。佛堂本身被燒塌的瓦礫埋沒，其東西兩端是帶拱形天井的側廊，通向同樣有拱形天井的佛堂背後狹小的內室。本圖展示的壁畫是，從斯坦因命名爲xiii的此有拱形天井的狹小內室發現的。壁畫是內室外壁東側一半約3.5米長的牆圍子。斯坦因還從火災之前就被堆積層堵塞的西邊側廊發現了一面壁畫（Mi.xiii.10）。那壁畫也收藏于大英博物館，其畫面狀態比當時《西域》（參照圖CXXI V）中展示時的還要惡化。
壁畫首先從多個比丘聽授教法的場景開始。年長的比丘腰倚方形的凳子，能明顯能看出年齡（第95－2圖）等，有的腳被斜向橫過的裝飾遮隱，而大多數連放腳或腿的臺子都被描繪出來。另一面，弟子們在前面屈膝而坐。第一場景（第95－3圖）中，無論師父還是弟子都在細長的菩提葉上寫字。上空繪著散花的飛天手持毛筆（圖95－2）。而在另一場景中，從上空乘雲飛來的像是偏袒右肩的佛，其下有兩組比丘和天部在合掌贊頌（圖95－4）。另一場景只保存了一部分，可辨出師父前匍匐的虔誠比丘的身姿（圖95－5）。此景象，使人想起布髮本生的場面（參照圖117）。
此連環壁畫儘管色彩豐富，但遠不及奧登堡從同一佛寺發現現存于艾爾米塔什美術館的兩幅大壁畫。在其報告中刊載了那兩幅壁畫的彩色圖版（參照Oldenburg，Russkays Turkestanskaya Ekspedit-siya.Goda,1909~1910,1914,圖版IX,X）。其中一面上，有手貼在臉，沈浸於深深地悲哀中的貴族女性，旁邊跪著穿典型回鶻裝的少年，兩人的背後立著極大的佛像。另一面壁畫無疑與主室門口的其它壁畫不同，那裏描繪的是兩身菩薩和數身比丘，有幾個比丘是跪姿。兩面都是精致的描繪，使用了華麗的色彩，還加了大量的金彩。
相比之下，斯坦因的壁畫也許是描繪在內室內壁下部這一既不重要也不顯眼的場所，色彩和主題都稍差。但在此壁畫可以看出克孜爾石窟壁畫風格的山水描繪，這一點很重要。比丘各自坐在山中的石窟或佛龕中抄寫經文。山的輪廓用墨繪成圓頭的臺階狀(圖 95-10, 11)。那山排成一列，其上方可見第二列。臺階狀的山的輪廓使人想起克孜爾石窟的多數天井畫。克孜爾石窟裏，半球形的整面天井上，描繪著以模式化的山水爲背景的本生圖。明屋壁畫上的山水雖然不是連续遮掩整面，但還能見到其他類似點，就是那些山上隨處可見的樹和動物等（圖95－11）的描繪。跪拜的少年（圖95－8）的衣服和髮型也能够證明此連環的壁畫是回鶻時期的，其年代最遲不過8～9世紀。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts (right); Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
The site at Shorchuk, to which Stein gave the local name, Ming-oi (“Thousand Dwellings”), lies on a ridge to the north of the village, some sixty kilometers south of Karashahr. In antiquity all of the many shrines, with the exception of a series of caves, had been destroyed by fire, and had largely collapsed inwards. The fire, as well as being destructive, had a preservative effect upon parts of the stucco ornament of the shrines, especially in the case of the heads of many figures, which had been made with greater care and attention than the limbs and bodies. By and large, wall paintings did not survive, with the exception of fragments from one shrine. Apart from small fragments, the pieces shown here and in the following plates are the only items of wall painting from the Stein Collection now in the British Museum; the rest are all in New Delhi.
    The fragments come from a temple in the northwestern part of the site, the only recognizable part of a complex of halls and rooms. When examined by Stein, he thought that the entrance hall had in fact already been partially cleared. However, although Grunwedel had earlier visited the site in Jone 1906 (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 191ff), Oldenburg was later to recover more paintings from this same entrance hall (see below). Beyond the entrance hall was a cella five metres square, the entrance of which had once been flanked by a statue on each side. The cella itself was filled with burnt brickwork; on its east and west sides vaulted passages led to a narrow chamber, also vaulted, behind the cella. It was in this narrow vaulted chamber, designated xiii by Stein, that the paintings shown here were found. They formed a continuous dado along the foot of the outer wall for about three and a half metres in the eastern half of the chamber. Stein also recovered one panel (Mi. xiii. 10) from the western passage, which had been blocked by debris before the fire. This panel is also in the British Museum, but the surface has deteriorated since it was reproduced in Serindia (Pl. CXXIV).
    The series of panels begins with scenes of monks receiving instruction. The senior monks, some of them clearly aged (Pl. 95-2), are seated on square stools, some with closed-in sides, others open showing the legs and stretchers, and incorporating a foot-rest. Their pupils, on the other hand, kneel in front of them. In the first scene (Pl. 95-1), both master and pupils are writing on tablets, which have the long narrow shape of pothi leaves. In the sky above, a descending apsaras brings a writing brush, in an interesting variation on the more usual theme of scattering flowers (Pl. 95-2). In another scene, the figure descending on clouds from above appears from his dress to be a Buddha; below him two groups of monks and devatas kneel in adoration (Pl. 95-4). Another scene, only partially preserved, shows a monk prostrating himself in front of his master, in a gesture reminiscent of the Vow before Dipankara (Pl. 95-8; cf. Pl. 117).
    Despite the colourfulness of this series of panels, they are easily outshone by the two larger panels recovered from the same shrine by Oldenburg, which are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. They are reproduced in colour in his report (Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. IX, X). One of them shows a lady of high rank, apparently in great grief, as she raises her hand to her face. Nearby kneels a small boy in typical Uighur costume. They are both just behind a very much larger figure of the Buddha. The other panel, which must have been on the other side of the doorway in the main hall of the shrine, shows two Bodhisattvas and a number of monks, some of them kneeling. Both paintings are very finely drawn and lavishly coloured, and gold is used quite extensively. By comparison, the Stein panels, occupying a relatively humble and obscure position low on the rear wall of the rear chamber of the shrine, are correspondingly muted in both colouring and subject matter. They are, however, extremely important since the landscape settings still preserve elements that must derive from the art of the Kizil caves. Each of the monks seated and transcribing texts is placed in a niche or cave within a hill whose contours rise in a series of rounded steps, outlined in ink (Pls. 95-10, 11). The hills are lined up one beside the other, and a second row is seen above them. It is principally the stepped contour of the hills that recalls the ceilings of many of the Kizil caves, where jataka stories are illustrated in a landscape setting of stylized hills, repeated over the whole roof vault. Although the arrangement in the Ming-oi panels is not continuous so as to fill the whole space, there are other similarities as well, namely the occasional tree or animal seen around the edges or the hills (Pl. 95-11). Thus while the costume and hair fashion of the small kneeling boy (Pl. 95-6) is clear evidence of the Uighur dating of these paintings, at the latest they are eighth or ninth century.; Chinese

斯坦因採用當地語言“明屋（千家）”命名的此遺址，在焉耆向南約60公里處，散佈在碩爾楚克北面的山地裏。除石窟外，許多寺院在古代都曾遭受過火災，向里倒塌。當然，火災有帶來破壞的一面，但也有有利的一面，寺院用灰泥裝飾部分，特別是佛像頭部，它比軀體、手腳製作的更認真，燃燒使之變得更結實，起到了保護的效果。除了一個寺院的一個壁畫殘片外，壁畫幾乎都沒有留下。另外，斯坦因收集的壁畫，藏在大英博物館的，除了極小的斷片外，大概只有本圖所展示的作品了，其它都收藏在新德里。
本圖的壁畫是在位于遺迹西北部只剩大廳和幾閒屋的佛寺中發現的。斯坦因認爲，在自己開始考察之前，入口的大廳曾有人涉足。而格倫威德爾訪問此地是1906年6月（參照Grunwedel：Alt-Buddhistische Kultstutten in Chinesische-Turkistan 1912,191頁），後奧登堡從此入口的大廳發現了另一壁畫（見下）。入口的大廳深處有5米見方的正方形内殿，其門兩側似乎有過塑像。佛堂本身被燒塌的瓦礫埋沒，其東西兩端是帶拱形天井的側廊，通向同樣有拱形天井的佛堂背後狹小的內室。本圖展示的壁畫是，從斯坦因命名爲xiii的此有拱形天井的狹小內室發現的。壁畫是內室外壁東側一半約3.5米長的牆圍子。斯坦因還從火災之前就被堆積層堵塞的西邊側廊發現了一面壁畫（Mi.xiii.10）。那壁畫也收藏于大英博物館，其畫面狀態比當時《西域》（參照圖CXXI V）中展示時的還要惡化。
壁畫首先從多個比丘聽授教法的場景開始。年長的比丘腰倚方形的凳子，能明顯能看出年齡（第95－2圖）等，有的腳被斜向橫過的裝飾遮隱，而大多數連放腳或腿的臺子都被描繪出來。另一面，弟子們在前面屈膝而坐。第一場景（第95－3圖）中，無論師父還是弟子都在細長的菩提葉上寫字。上空繪著散花的飛天手持毛筆（圖95－2）。而在另一場景中，從上空乘雲飛來的像是偏袒右肩的佛，其下有兩組比丘和天部在合掌贊頌（圖95－4）。另一場景只保存了一部分，可辨出師父前匍匐的虔誠比丘的身姿（圖95－5）。此景象，使人想起布髮本生的場面（參照圖117）。
此連環壁畫儘管色彩豐富，但遠不及奧登堡從同一佛寺發現現存于艾爾米塔什美術館的兩幅大壁畫。在其報告中刊載了那兩幅壁畫的彩色圖版（參照Oldenburg，Russkays Turkestanskaya Ekspedit-siya.Goda,1909~1910,1914,圖版IX,X）。其中一面上，有手貼在臉，沈浸於深深地悲哀中的貴族女性，旁邊跪著穿典型回鶻裝的少年，兩人的背後立著極大的佛像。另一面壁畫無疑與主室門口的其它壁畫不同，那裏描繪的是兩身菩薩和數身比丘，有幾個比丘是跪姿。兩面都是精致的描繪，使用了華麗的色彩，還加了大量的金彩。
相比之下，斯坦因的壁畫也許是描繪在內室內壁下部這一既不重要也不顯眼的場所，色彩和主題都稍差。但在此壁畫可以看出克孜爾石窟壁畫風格的山水描繪，這一點很重要。比丘各自坐在山中的石窟或佛龕中抄寫經文。山的輪廓用墨繪成圓頭的臺階狀(圖 95-10, 11)。那山排成一列，其上方可見第二列。臺階狀的山的輪廓使人想起克孜爾石窟的多數天井畫。克孜爾石窟裏，半球形的整面天井上，描繪著以模式化的山水爲背景的本生圖。明屋壁畫上的山水雖然不是連续遮掩整面，但還能見到其他類似點，就是那些山上隨處可見的樹和動物等（圖95－11）的描繪。跪拜的少年（圖95－8）的衣服和髮型也能够證明此連環的壁畫是回鶻時期的，其年代最遲不過8～9世紀。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts (left); Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
The site at Shorchuk, to which Stein gave the local name, Ming-oi (“Thousand Dwellings”), lies on a ridge to the north of the village, some sixty kilometers south of Karashahr. In antiquity all of the many shrines, with the exception of a series of caves, had been destroyed by fire, and had largely collapsed inwards. The fire, as well as being destructive, had a preservative effect upon parts of the stucco ornament of the shrines, especially in the case of the heads of many figures, which had been made with greater care and attention than the limbs and bodies. By and large, wall paintings did not survive, with the exception of fragments from one shrine. Apart from small fragments, the pieces shown here and in the following plates are the only items of wall painting from the Stein Collection now in the British Museum; the rest are all in New Delhi.
    The fragments come from a temple in the northwestern part of the site, the only recognizable part of a complex of halls and rooms. When examined by Stein, he thought that the entrance hall had in fact already been partially cleared. However, although Grunwedel had earlier visited the site in Jone 1906 (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 191ff), Oldenburg was later to recover more paintings from this same entrance hall (see below). Beyond the entrance hall was a cella five metres square, the entrance of which had once been flanked by a statue on each side. The cella itself was filled with burnt brickwork; on its east and west sides vaulted passages led to a narrow chamber, also vaulted, behind the cella. It was in this narrow vaulted chamber, designated xiii by Stein, that the paintings shown here were found. They formed a continuous dado along the foot of the outer wall for about three and a half metres in the eastern half of the chamber. Stein also recovered one panel (Mi. xiii. 10) from the western passage, which had been blocked by debris before the fire. This panel is also in the British Museum, but the surface has deteriorated since it was reproduced in Serindia (Pl. CXXIV).
    The series of panels begins with scenes of monks receiving instruction. The senior monks, some of them clearly aged (Pl. 95-2), are seated on square stools, some with closed-in sides, others open showing the legs and stretchers, and incorporating a foot-rest. Their pupils, on the other hand, kneel in front of them. In the first scene (Pl. 95-1), both master and pupils are writing on tablets, which have the long narrow shape of pothi leaves. In the sky above, a descending apsaras brings a writing brush, in an interesting variation on the more usual theme of scattering flowers (Pl. 95-2). In another scene, the figure descending on clouds from above appears from his dress to be a Buddha; below him two groups of monks and devatas kneel in adoration (Pl. 95-4). Another scene, only partially preserved, shows a monk prostrating himself in front of his master, in a gesture reminiscent of the Vow before Dipankara (Pl. 95-8; cf. Pl. 117).
    Despite the colourfulness of this series of panels, they are easily outshone by the two larger panels recovered from the same shrine by Oldenburg, which are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. They are reproduced in colour in his report (Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. IX, X). One of them shows a lady of high rank, apparently in great grief, as she raises her hand to her face. Nearby kneels a small boy in typical Uighur costume. They are both just behind a very much larger figure of the Buddha. The other panel, which must have been on the other side of the doorway in the main hall of the shrine, shows two Bodhisattvas and a number of monks, some of them kneeling. Both paintings are very finely drawn and lavishly coloured, and gold is used quite extensively. By comparison, the Stein panels, occupying a relatively humble and obscure position low on the rear wall of the rear chamber of the shrine, are correspondingly muted in both colouring and subject matter. They are, however, extremely important since the landscape settings still preserve elements that must derive from the art of the Kizil caves. Each of the monks seated and transcribing texts is placed in a niche or cave within a hill whose contours rise in a series of rounded steps, outlined in ink (Pls. 95-10, 11). The hills are lined up one beside the other, and a second row is seen above them. It is principally the stepped contour of the hills that recalls the ceilings of many of the Kizil caves, where jataka stories are illustrated in a landscape setting of stylized hills, repeated over the whole roof vault. Although the arrangement in the Ming-oi panels is not continuous so as to fill the whole space, there are other similarities as well, namely the occasional tree or animal seen around the edges or the hills (Pl. 95-11).

Leaflet on the Yantras on the Blue Cloth (No. 10)
The pages aren’t numbered. Starting with the side which has a diamond-in-a-square yantra in the upper left-hand corner:
Top row, left to right:
Yan Phoksap (Wealth Yantra)   [Square yantra with a diamond in it]
This yantra, whoever encountered it, it is the merit of that person. You should have it installed in the places where you keep money [or silver] or gold. The money or gold won’t go missing. Or you can install it in a money purse. Whoever has this yantra installed, his/her money [silver] and gold will grow continuously, most marvellously. Have it consecrated with the heart of the Totsachat [last 10 Jataka stories], that is: Khue Te Cha Su Ne Ma Phu Cha Na Wi We, etc. [Apparently these are syllables from the names of the stories. ‘Heart syllables’ of various bits of Buddhist litany are often used as part of yantras or sacred chants as magical (tantric) devices.]  
Yan Krao Phet (Diamond Armor Yantra)
Yantra of Luang Pho Pan of Wat Bangnomkho, amphoe [district] Sena, Ayutthaya province. It has qualities which are excellent in every way.  It will be as if one has diamond armor protecting one from all dangers and catastrophes.
[Luang Pho Pan is a monk of the late 19th to early 20th centuries said to have achieved advanced spiritual power due to his assiduous practices. He is known for creating this yantra and for others, as well as for the votive tablets he produced, which are also said to have great powers of protection and healing.]
Yan Kan Khai Rai (Yantra for Protection Against Severe Illness)
This yantra is a yantra used for protection against various severe illnesses which can make one hurt and sick and which did not exist in ancient times. Doctors tend to use this yantra to protect against catastraphe while travelling. 
Bottom row, left to right:
Yan Fonsaenha (Firework Yantra)  [Fonsaenha can mean a firework, a kind of flowering plant or a heavy rain. I’m guessing here it means the firework.] 
This yantra is very marvellous. No matter if there are enemies of humans or there are gods, one will not have to be afraid. Install the yantra and then consecrate it yourself. If having an illness or an eye ailment, take a takrut [a rolled up plate or flat piece of something, with the yantra inscribed on it], soak it with drops of water, eat it, and the ailment will disappear. If going into battle, take yakhatmon, sanphramon, and khondinso [kinds of plants], 4 stalks, the takrut will make one invincible. The value is a hundred thousand tamleung [an old monetary unit] of gold.
Yan Kambang (Shielding Yantra)
This yantra you would consecrate with this gatha [stanza]: 
‘Nabang mopit phutmit tha lom tua ya hai hua bai bat ni phut mai hen i’, repeating it three times. This yantra, when you are in dire straits, stick it to your brow. Proceed and no one will be able to see you. It’s very good.
Yan Ni Pluk Yan (This Yantra Activates Yantras)
This yantra is used to plant [activate] other all other yantras. It increases the Buddha-power of other yantras to make their power lasting.  
Other side of page:
Top row, left to right:
Yan Phra Phutthanimit (Yantra of the Sign of the Buddha)
This yantra, after having it installed as the Gatha Phutthanimit all around, have it consecrated with the Gatha Phutthanimit. This takrut is a jewel of inestimable value. It is tremendously marvellous. For all things it is possible to use it. 
Yan Mongkut Phra Phuttha Chao (Yantra of the Crown of the Lord Buddha)
This sacred yantra is for establishing in a magical cloth [pha jiet]. A cloth yantra for going into battle is in the Kamphi Phra Phichaisongkhram [Treatise on Military Strategy – an ancient Thai manual]. After setting the yantra in the cloth have it consecrated with the Gatha Mongkut Phra Phuttha Chao:
[This is to be read all the way across both lines, and then down. It’s in Pali:]
 
i ti pi so wi se se i		i se se phuttha na me i
i me na phuttha tang so i  	i so tang phuttha pi ti i  etc.
And having it consecrated with the gatha which surrounds that yantra, it will be a great magical cloth protecting against disasters and dangers of all kinds in the water and on the land.
Yan Mahawet (Yantra of Great Magic)
This yantra is consecrated with ‘na ma pha tha ehinmo phuttha ehinmo thamma ehinmo sangkha ya nuphawena hakari phra patchekaphothihakri suchakrawalechantho sapphethewa ku che riak riak sapphethewa ku cha phuk phuk sapphethewa ku cha sup sup sapphethewa akhatchaiya akhatchahi phanthang phanthang, etc.’   [Pali language, with some Thai]
This gatha is used to gather and invite the sacred [‘phra’: Buddha, monks, dhamma, devatas], used to gather the gathas, all of them, calling all, activating all. If one’s knife doesn’t penetrate them, use this gatha to call all their goodness to come to us. The knife will enter them, every person. It will be such that one will have at one’s disposal all magical substances and incantations so the knife will penetrate.

Yan Solot Mahamongkon (Yantra of the Great Auspicious Sixteen)
Na ma na o 	no ko na ka
Ko o no o	no ko na ang
This gatha consecrates a phakhaoma [a square cloth, usually worn by men] tied around the head or around the waist. It protects against enemies and protects against threats while travelling or when in an emergency. Opponents will not dare to think of doing harm. It protects you when you leave home. Have a face cloth consecrated and then make it into a knot. When you reach your destination, loosen it. It protects against enemies of all kinds. It is auspicious throughout the whole universe. Very marvellous. 
Yan Rahun (Rahula Yantra)
These two sacred yantras are of inestimable value. Finding something comparable is difficult. They bring results in prosperity and happiness in fortune and prestige. One will always have wealth in property, money and gold. They are great and constant loving-kindness (metta). You will always escape from dangers and live in invincibility, safeguarded from demons, ghosts, ogres, and evil. You will be protected from disease and will travel with good fortune and success.  
Yan Oklao (Oklao Yantra)  [Oklao is the wooden ridge which covers the crack between old-style entryways where there are two wooden doors, one on the right and another on the left, that close by meeting in the middle.]
The front entrance to the vihara of Phra Chinarat Buddha or Luang Pho Yai has large and beautiful doors with detailed decorations. Built in 1756, they are the work of royal craftsmen of the late Ayutthaya era in the reign of King Borommakot [r. 1733-58]. In the middle of the doors is the oklao ridge decorated with phumkhaobin [a design depicting a decorative piece which is placed at the top of towers on monastic buildings.]. In the center of the oklao is an image of diamond shape called “nom oklao.” People believe that it is a sacred object which can protect well against various dangers.",,Not on display,"Exhibited:
