The two schemes mentioned relate to the arrangement of the drapery folds on the over-robe or outer-garment of Gandharan standing Buddha figures. There are two types of folds: major and minor folds. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them there may be minor folds, usually thin ribs in very low relief. The alternation of major and minor folds may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1), or may be concentrated on the upper part of the body (see 1899.0715.1). There are also sculptures where the minor folds are almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11).

The term ‘backthrow’ refers to that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped.
The two schemes mentioned relate to the arrangement of the drapery folds on the over-robe or outer-garment of Gandharan standing Buddha figures. There are two types of folds: major and minor folds. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them there may be minor folds, usually thin ribs in very low relief. The alternation of major and minor folds may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1), or may be concentrated on the upper part of the body (see 1899.0715.1). There are also sculptures where the minor folds are almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11). The folds are usually arranged according to two basic rules: the folds above the middle are generally centred on the right side of the body, and those downwards from it are distributed along a vertical line between the legs.
Two recurrent features of the draped Buddha image relate to the fall of the drapery, which can be represented as cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it (see 1947.0511.1), or as an edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow, which goes along the left forearm and is held to secure the robes in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped from the first layer of cloth (the undergarment), usually appears looped (see 1899.0715.1).",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and exfoliated.

The edge of the outer garment, worn to leave the right shoulder bare, is in higher relief across the chest where an undergarment is visible above it. Between the knees and lying flat on the seat are a semi-circular lower edge and thicker undulating fall of gathered drapery from the right forearm, where an edge of the backthrow is drawn close and a small loop hangs beside it. The drapery folds are a mixture of ridges and terraces with rounded edges. The head, inclined downwards, is oval to square, and the hair undulates densely into the large globular uṣṇīṣa, which is bound by a thin twisted cord with a small disc in the middle. The forehead is narrow above sharp curved edges for eyebrows and long narrow eyes with heavy lids slant downwards to the proper left. The flat nose under the rather high ūrṇā continues the sharp browlines. The mouth is shaped with a hint of a moustache indicated by a small convexity on both sides of the large oval philtrum or vertical groove on the upper lip; the chin is full and the concave ears have short lobes.
The Buddha sits leaning forward, and while there are slight swellings to indicate the breasts, the abdomen is very flat. Above the bare arm a slight contraction below the shoulder suggests, with the elbow, biceps, and below the elbow the arm curves and tapers. The hands have straight thumbs and fluid fingers with nails. The fingers of the lower hand all touch the bottom of the upper, whose fingers curve round the columnar projection on the chest which also produces the required webbed effect between the fingers. The very summary upturned feet appear under the drapery and partly uncovered on the Buddha's right.
The seat, under a cushion with a horizontal band containing an undulating line, has two stylised lion's legs with drapery in between, and against the drapery a preaching Buddha with both shoulders covered, a semi-circular edge of the overrobe below but no fall of gathered drapery, a flattened face and rounded protruding eyes sits on the gynoecium of a lotus; he is flanked by a figure with a chignon and another in a turban. Both are unhaloed and seated, with the hands as in dhyāna, the legs crossed above the ankles and wearing an uttarīya, collar, earrings and bracelets.

The over-robe covers both shoulders with a wide neckline and prominent folds form a 'V' on the front, which barely indicate the backthrow. It has to be noted that the backthrow does not appear under the left forearm. The garment is worn close-fitting, almost in the fashion of wet drapery; the breasts, abdomen and legs, particularly the flexed right knee, are plainly indicated and the ridged and grooved indications of folds are accentuated between the legs and above the left hand which grasps a short and looped length of drapery, while gathered drapery hangs below. The usual two undergarments appear below the drapery fall of the 'abhaya-mudra' arm. The shoulders are broad and enhanced by the width of the neckline and the grooved neck, while the torso appears foreshortened, the waist thin, the legs mechanically rounded and the toes and feet summarily modelled. The hands are large, the right with curved fingers, a membrane between index and thumb and a circle ringed with dots on the palm. The head is round to oval and the face full. The snail-shell curls are formed of originally applied and incised small discs continued into the large uṣṇīṣa and forming a peak over the forehead. Incised brows form wide arches over long and protruding globular eyes under low lids; the nose is straight with a sharp ridge; and the shaped mouth, with a fuller lower lip, is set into the broad lower face above a full chin. The damaged ears are close to the head and probably had long lobes.
The backplate has the form of an aureole combining a mandorla and nimbus. It is outlined with a foliate band and with radiating projections formed of a circular bead and a pointed drop or leaf, both with a border, ending in three plain circular beads.

Although metal technology from tool-making to the abundant minting of a money economy was clearly well understood, Buddhist metal sculpture has proved elusive, with the examples known today being few, of modest size and mainly late. See also 1958.0714.1.
The face may be compared with others of the stucco tradition and Gupta-period Mathura Buddhas.
The term ‘backthrow’ refers to that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped. Two recurrent features of the draped Buddha image relate to the fall of the drapery, which can be represented as cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it (see 1947.0511.1), or as an edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow, which goes along the left forearm and is held to secure the robes in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped from the first layer of cloth (the undergarment), usually appears looped (see 1899.0715.1).; Zwalf 1985
This very different example from the few surviving Gandharan bronzes belongs to a group from a single findspot and perhaps atelier. The ridged drapery is very conventional, and the face recalls not only the later Gandharan stucco sculpture but, even farther afield, Gupta-period Buddhas from central India such as that from Mankuwar dated to AD 448-9 (or 429). The backplate, common to the whole group, has a radiating ornament which appears early in Gandhara, but its closest resemblance is with painting dated to the 7th century.","von Schroeder 1981 / Indo-Tibetan Bronzes; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Errington & Cribb 1992 / The Crossroads of Asia  [Cat. of an exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge]; Koezuka (1994) / Masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu Art from the British Museum; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum",On display (G33/dc51b/s3),"Exhibited:

The raised right arm and distinct backthrow (that part of the robe which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped) on the somewhat thick, plunging neckline result in the usual two schemes of drapery folds on the overrobe of the standing Buddha image. According to these schemes, curves above the middle are centred on the right side of the body and those downwards from it along a vertical line between the legs. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets, as here, and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them may be minor folds, usually a thin rib in very low relief; as on the present figure the alternation may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1 and 1961.0519.1); in other cases  it is concentrated in the upper body (see 1899.0715.1 or 1940.0713.8); and the minor folds may also be almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11). Two other recurrent features of the draped Buddha image are the more or less thick fall of drapery, representing cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it, here dense and ending in meandering edges, and the edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow drawn along and under the left forearm and held to secure the robes more thoroughly in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped before draping, usually appears looped (see 1950.1211.6).",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/od),,"1.

The head is round to square, the face set back below the narrow and curved forehead. The hair, in regular curls of several strands, runs over the uṣṇīṣa, which has a small central hole, up to the halo; the eyebrows are a very sharp edge in a low arch above horizontal eyes with prominent drooping lids.

This is one of the three clay Gandhāran sculptures in the Museum (see also 1856,0412.1 and 1880.122).; E. Errington: Masson records excavating a mound at the entrance to Khol Shams, south of Kabul, in 1833 (1842, vol.3, pp.93-6). He found an 'arched recess, ornamentally carved, and supported by two slender pillars. In it [were] the remains of several earthen images; the heads of the two larger ones only were sufficiently entire to bear removal. They were evidently of female figures, and of very regular and handsome features ... slight traces ascertain that the figures had been originally covered with layers of white and red paint, and that over the latter had been placed a surface of gold leaf. The hair of the heads, tastefully arranged in curls, had been painted with an azure colour. The recess also had been embellished with gold leaf and lapis lazuli tints'. The two heads, and fragments of a birch bark manuscript from the site (see 1880.3891.b) were dispatched from Kabul, together with 8 stucco Buddha heads from Hadda (see 1880.107, 109-119, 121) in December 1834 (MSS Eur. E 161/VII, f.22), finally arriving in London in mid 1837 (Errington 2006, pp.90, 92, n.28).
Although no documentation linking this head and 1880.122 to Masson or the India Museum appears to survive, the likelihood of their being the two from Khol Shams is reinforced by the following points. We know that the heads reached the India Museum with the rest of the 1834 shipment in 1837. 1880.106 and 1880.122 are the only two clay objects without provenance in the collection that fit the description of the missing heads: 1880.122 appears to be the head of a woman and, at the time of excavation, Masson did not realise the Buddhist nature of his finds and routinely describes Buddha heads as female. Painted clay figures of the 4th-5th century and later predominate at Hadda and sites around Kabul, Zwalf (above) notes the stylistic affinity between this head and 1880.110-112, 1880.117 acquired by Masson at Hadda. There are even stronger links with the painted clay statues from the neighbouring Kabul site of Tepe Marinjan (see F. Tissot, Catalogue of the National Museum of Afghanistan 1931-1985, Unesco Paris 2006, pp.343-5).","Masson 1842 / Narrative of Various Journeys in Balochistan, Afghanistan and the Panjab; Masson MSS Eur.

A sample of powdery material from the core of the object has been analysed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) in an attempt to determine the material of the object. \n The results suggest that it is made from a calcareous 'clay' containing mica (and the clay mineral illite), chlorite, amphibole and feldspar, in addition to quartz, which is the dominant phase, and calcite. \n The XRD pattern indicates that the mixture is unlikely to have been fired above about 500-600° (and may well, as suspected, be unfired).

There are small curls in higher relief beside the short projecting ears, which are slightly concave and have grooved lobes. The forehead is narrow and modelled. The eyebrows have a gently curving edge above a modelled slope to the open eyes, which have narrow lids over flat eyeballs.

Two recurrent features of the draped Buddha image relate to the fall of the drapery, which can be represented as cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it (see 1947.0511.1), or as an edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow (that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped), which goes along the left forearm and is held to secure the robes in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped from the first layer of cloth (the undergarment), usually appears looped, as in this figure.
For this early type see Marshall, 1960: 61, referring to similar figures as 'the earliest of their kind', and plus 58-9, figs 85-6. For other similar types see Peshawar 2086 (Tissot, 1985a: fig. 149); Berlin MIK 1 44, 114, 527; Cleveland 72.43, dated (Czuma, 1985: no. 107) to the second half of the 2nd century.; Zwalf 1985
The angle of the right forearm and rough projection at the armpit where a strut supported the lost hand show that this Buddha was in the gesture of reassurance, offering protection to the worshipper. The left hand holds an end of cloth from the robe, and the lower undergarment can be seen above the lost feet. There is a noticeable moustache on the upper lip, and the broken halo has traces of an ancient repair. In type this Buddha is reminiscent of that on the Kaniṣka coin (no. 121).",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Koezuka (1994) / Masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu Art from the British Museum; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

(Object),,,"Panel showing the Submission of Apalāla. The haloed Buddha, his body in three-quarter view but with the head almost in profile, stands in a crescentic curve, the overrobe covering both shoulders and the raised neckline evenly curving. He raises one hand with the palm partly inwards, while the other hand secures the robe at waist level. His eyes are open; the hair undulates into the small uṣṇīṣa and the halo has a narrow border. Behind the Buddha stands a Vajrapāṇi, a rounded vajra at his shoulder; he appears rather like a rustic or ascetic with a large nose and bulbous eyes, abundantly bearded, full-bellied and wearing a short paridhāna with a thick girdle (uttarīya).
In a small fenced tank in front of the Buddha three figures, each with a serpent rising from behind, join their hands. The first, male, has a five-headed serpent, and wears a crested turban with large globular ornament and an uttarīya; the second, a female, wears a sleeved tunic and another garment from her left shoulder, a necklace, earring, bracelet, a wreath headdress and flower in the hair beneath a single rearing serpent; the third, also female, similarly dressed and under a single serpent, turns to look in dread over her shoulder at another Vajrapāṇi. The rectangular tank is enclosed by a plain wall with a rocky terrain at its foot and mouldings with sawtooth enrichment beneath a vedikā of plain, worn uprights crossed by bars of curved section under a coping with sawtooth enrichment. Low down on the side facing the Buddha a spout in the form of a lion's head appears to emit water.
Beside and above the tank, small rounded bluffs with patches of vegetation conveyed by radiating lines indicate mountainous terrain (see BM 1902.1002.18) which appears to oversail the tank. Within it a muscular Vajrapāṇi, of less rustic and more threatening expression than the other, stands with one foot on a higher ledge, both arms stretched out, one holding a flattened faceted vajra.
The scene has on both sides a pilaster with, on the shaft, a long, narrow, recessed oblong panel curved at the top and bottom. It has a rectangular Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts and the usual base; its prominent plinth and torus seem parts of the complex lower frame. Above one pilaster a voluted double-bracket capital survives with sawtooth enrichment. On the right is a crenellated bastion with slanting returning walls, rectangular and pointed loopholes and a wall above receding according to a form of perspective. Beyond the left-hand pilaster two figures are separated by a tree; one may be a woman in a tunic and paridhāna without ornaments who is holding (receiving) a bowl in one or both hands; the other, facing, a male figure possibly with a crested turban, a paridhāna and a twisted scarf wound twice across the torso, seems to stretch out one hand under the bowl and with the other appears to hold the hilt of a sword. Behind is another tree.

Only sources in translation now give an account of a dragon of Swat named  Apalāla who, with his wife and children, ravaged the crops and was brought into submission by the Buddha, in some instances with the vigorous help of Vajrapāṇi. Originally situated in Magadha, this event became associated with the Buddha's legendary travels in the Northwest and acquired a local importance.
The appearance of the second and aggressive Vajrapāṇi assaulting the nāga and his family, to all appearances in continuous narration, is explained by Foucher (1905-51: I, 550-3) as an adaptation of the composition used for the subject of BM 1880.196. The placid Vajrapāṇi of the latter remains beside the Buddha and is supplemented by a more suitable for the task, usually above the nāgas in the mountainous landscape of Swat. Representations have the nāga(s) standing upright as in the following piece; half-length as above in a tank or water; half-length without any aquatic feature as in BM 1962.1114.1 and Berlin MIK I 182; kneeling below a rocky landscape with or without any aquatic feature; in a cave with the source of the Swat river; in a cave apparently without or on a rocky mound lapped by water.

The haloed and seated Buddha wears the over-robe leaving his right shoulder and feet bare and an undergarment visible below his right shoulder; it lies on the seat beside a fall of gathered drapery from his left wrist which spreads out. The drapery folds are defined mainly by paired grooves separating broad flat strips. The head is a long and regular oval; the hair, representing the Indian snail-shell curl tradition, consists of a series of beaded rows running from side to side and concentric on the uṣṇīṣa. The eyes are rounded and open with prominent lids under gently rounded brows, and there is no ūrṇā. The nose is broad, the mouth shaped, the chin prominent and the concave ears stand out symmetrically. The hands have long fluid fingers, the left index and middle fingers touching the bottom of the right hand in the preaching gesture. The Buddha's seat is the top of an obconical gynoecium tapering into a lotus with two downturned rows of plain petals, the lower row showing another beneath.
The Bodhisattva on the Buddha's left wears a patterned collar and a necklace with a plain strand and one of beads, and the uttarīya loops in the narrow mode. His left hand holds a damaged garland and his right may have been in 'abhayamudra'. The turban has a large crest and tapering central ornament, and retaining bands radiate from below it. The face is oval and long with long, narrow, low-lidded eyes and a long, straight, rather prominent mouth. The earrings have pendent beads. The other Bodhisattva, presumably Maitreya, wears a similar collar and necklace, a cord with a crescentic amulet and three or four boxes, one cylindrical, paridhāna and uttarīya with paired grooves for folds and worn in the wide mode; a water pot was probably held in his lost left hand. Most of his right forearm is lost; the hand may have been in 'abhayamudra' or turned palm inwards. He wears a diadem, earrings with beaded hoop and a horizontal length of hair, knotted over a chignon and looped on one side. His face, similar to that of the other Bodhisattva, is more gently rounded. Both Bodhisattvas lack the ūrṇā, are haloed and stand on feet with long toes on a lotus pedestal like the Buddha's; one lotus also has a short stalk. The three haloes overlap.
Below the Buddha an incense-burner or lamp (showing flames rather than smoke) on a columnar stand is flanked by a worshipper with knee-length tunic, ornamented trousers, moustache, two horizontal rows of curls over the forehead,
vertical bands of curls above and a chignon, kneeling with hands joined while a woman with a prominent band of hair in front and a loop of hair behind kneels opposite; she wears armlets, bracelets, earrings, collar, a tunic, a cloak gathered over her right leg and a scarf. Both have small, protruding, rounded eyes.
Above the haloes may be the remains of flying figures bearing a crown or garland.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Jamalgarhi,stone,,,carved,Diameter: 9.70 centimetres; Height: 40.60 centimetres; Width: 27.30 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
Relatively simple triads of a seated Buddha preaching and flanked by more or less frontal standing Bodhisattvas have been grouped with more complicated, densely inhabited and sometimes architecturally very ornate panels, often with the same Bodhisattvas less prominent, standing or seated, also flanking a preaching Buddha. The Bodhisattva with a water pot is generally accepted as Maitreya but the opposite, turbaned figure is still subject to discussion. Either Bodhisattva may stand on the Buddha's right and can also vary in iconographic detail: both may hold the right hand in 'abhayamudra', but Maitreya may turn the palm inwards, or hold a lotus instead, and the turbaned figure may hold a lotus or garland in his left hand. All too often the hands and attributes are lost. The Buddha usually sits on an open lotus which may, as here, have petals turned down or pointing upwards and sometimes a stalk below rising out of water. Many other details vary.
This group was interpreted, following Divyāvadāna XII, as representing the multiplication aspect of the Miracle of Śrāvastī, the kneeling persons as Lūhasudatta and his wife and the flanking figures as Indra and Brahmā. Subsequent interpretations have been as 'ordinary worshipping scenes' with Bodhisattvas, as a general theophany symbolising immanence and power, as a revelation of doctrine to assemblies as in the Mahāyāna sūtras and as paradisiacal relief scenes with Amitābha in certain instances as the central Buddha. In an unpublished study Filigenzi sees the triads as simplified versions, appropriate for more personal worship, of the more complex theophanies which she interprets as manifestations of the saṃbhogakāya or divine principle as Buddha revealed to Bodhisattvas; while the flanking Bodhisattva with water pot is Maitreya, she sees the turbaned Bodhisattva as Avalokiteśvara and proposes varieties of solar iconography to identify him in Gandhāra. In another unpublished study, which draws much on work in Japanese, Rhi argues in detail against many of the past interpretations but believes it possible, judging iconographically, that what he has called preaching Buddha panels were an early representation of Śākyamuni and the Bodhisattvas Siddhārtha and Maitreya combined without specific textual sanction and offered for reasons of economy on a single relief instead of by means of separate statuary disposed in chapels; complex and later instances, where Avalokiteśvara may have replaced Siddhārtha, in his opinion reflect Śākyamuni expounding in structures and assemblies and exhibit a ritual elaboration drawn from the holding of festivals and processions.; Zwalf 1985
This slab with its worshippers in foreign dress beside a fire altar may be an icon of developing Buddhism. The central Buddha, flanked by Bodhisattvas and preaching, can be seen as expounding fresh doctrine as in many Mahāyāna ‘sūtras’. The Bodhisattvas are, on the left, Maitreya, since his distinguishing flask is almost preserved and, on the right, perhaps Avalokiteśvara, though he lacks the Buddha figure in the head-dress occasionally seen in Gandharan sculptures also in this context. This is an early example of the triads of Buddhas flanked by Bodhisattvas that became common later.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Shimada and Willis 2016 / Amaravati: The Art of an Early Buddhist Monument in Context,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The over-robe covers both shoulders and has an almost circular neckline with prominent ridged folds. In the front, the robe has regularly spaced and ridged folds following two schemes: a lower scheme of curves concentric with the neckline, which seems to be governed by the raised right forearm; and another of almost vertical folds from the neckline where, in addition, there seens to be a ridge of drapery rounding the vertical folds to the Buddha's right. This appears to reverse the usual direction taken by the backthrow. Nevertheless over the drapery folds on the back, which curve concentrically with the neckline, a backthrow hangs in the usual way behind and under the left forearm, and a length of drapery runs, without being held by them, across the left palm and between the thumb and index finger. The robe is slightly parted below the left forearm but a long undergarment can be seen only below the right arm and above the ankles. The surviving hand is large and the fingers, with distinguishable nails, partly separate pointing upwards. The feet, below columnar legs showing no ankle bones, are large and indifferently executed, with the toes flatter on the right foot.
The head is long and oval, with the features appearing almost applied on a gentle vertical curve to a narrow chin and long neck; the nose and mouth running slightly to the left. The hair is dense under a large uṣṇīṣa, with short grooved locks forming horizontal bands at the sides. Only in the middle, above the forehead, crescentic curls appear centred on a larger and circular curl. The eyebrows and eyes are horizontal, the eyes being long and narrow with distinct lids, and the ūrṇā in the middle is large and prominent. The thin nose is straight and without detail, and the upper lip is hardly distinguished above the groove separating it from the fuller lip below. The large ears are long, with an almost continuous raised border or helix, and close to the head with only the short lobes concave and projecting.",,,,,,,Kushan,4thC-5thC,Made in: Pakistan (probably),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,brass,,,cast,Diameter: 7 centimetres; Height: 41.60 centimetres; Width: 16.50 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
Although metal technology from tool-making to the abundant minting of a money economy was clearly well understood, Buddhist metal sculpture has proved elusive, with the examples known today being few, of modest size and mainly late. See also 1981.0610.1.
There is little modelling of the body. The abdomen and the back hindquarters can be distinguished under the fall of the robe, but the breasts are hardly indicated. The Buddha's stance is not wholly frontal: his right side has a forward movement, perhaps once enhanced by the lost hand as well as by the flexed leg. The face is most individual. Despite its youthful character, the long flat nose and the quite horizontal line of the eyes give it an unusual severity, examples of which can, however, also be found in later work in stone and in the stucco tradition. The face of an incomplete stucco figure, perhaps of a deity or bodhisattva (1887.0717.78), shows a great similarity, although executed in a much freer way and lacking the severity of gesture appreciated here.
The term ‘backthrow’ refers to that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped.
 
The precise metal composition of the figure can be found in ""Indo-Tibetan bronzes"" by von Schroeder, published in 1981 (p. 80).; Zwalf 1985
Presumably once making the gesture of reassurance, this rare example of a Gandharan bronze has a face of great individuality with its youthful open-eyed expression recalling the vivid later stucco sculptures. The ridged garment continues the Western realism in the Gandharan treatment of drapery but also contributes, with the large feet and hands, to a certain heaviness. If the dimensions were sufficient proof, this bronze might be one found by Cunningham at Mānikyāla.; Rawson 1992:
In Gandhara the Buddha was portrayed in his human form, not symbolically as had been the custom earlier in the Indian subcontinent. This image is a typical example and this model was adapted by the Chinese for their earliest images of the Buddha: the first Chinese bronze figures display the same U-shaped folds.
The very first Buddhist images in China had appeared only as incidental ornaments in tombs, mirrors and ceramics. In such contexts, they were equated with depictions of such spirits as the Queen Mother of the West. Under Chinese rule Buddhism was absorbed alongside other religious beliefs. Only under the rule of outsiders, from the fourth to the sixth century AD, such as the Liang in Gansu province and the Toba tribes (who took the title of Wei when they occupied North China), did Buddhism enjoy substantial imperial patronage. These foreign rulers encouraged the making of images in both stone and metal, including bronze, gold and silver.",von Schroeder 1981 / Indo-Tibetan Bronzes; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Rawson 1992 / The British Museum Book of Chinese Art; The Times 1959,On display (G33/dc51a/s1),"Exhibited:

From Whitfield 1985:
The remains of the Miran vihara M. Ⅱ, as described by Stein (Serindia, Vol. I, p. 487), consisted of a solid mound of sun-dried bricks, in two storeys, with a base 46 by 36 feet (about 13.8 by 10.8 m) and a second storey, badly decayed, 17 by 15 2/1 feet (5.1 by 4.65m). A passage about 10 feet (3 m) wide enclosed the central portion of the shrine, and was lined along the outer wall with a row of colossal seated images of the Buddha, each measuring 7 feet to 7 feet 3 inches (about 2.1m) across the knees, and all in dhyana-mudra. Of these only the bases, hands and legs were preserved, but the head seen here had been protected through falling into the space, wider at the back than at the front, between two of these figures. It originally belonged to the third of five figures uncovered by Stein.
Although the head itself evidently cannot provide a firm basis for dating, evidence of various kinds noted by Stein leads to the date given here. The drapery over the knees of the figures was arranged as at Gandhara, with three concentric folds falling from the hands. The folds on two of the statues were in the form of boldly raised plaits about an inch (2.5cm) wide and on the other three, including this one, as narrow double grooves. There were traces of red colour, similar to the statues from Rawak. Further evidence came from the shape of the Indo-Persian stucco pilasters around the vihara base. These also show Gandharan features and must have taken time to develop into the forms seen later at Endere and Khadalik. Probably the most conclusive evidence for the dating of the Miran vihara is provided by the finding of a palm leaf pothi in Sanskrit, written in Brahmi characters of an early Gupta type, which cannot be later than the fifth century A.D., and by the corresponding absence of any relics of Tibetan writing (in contrast to Endere and Khadalik, where Tibetan documents were found in abundance).; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
據斯坦因記述（參照《西域》487頁），米蘭寺院遺迹的第Ⅱ寺址是用曬乾的磚建造的結實的兩層建築物，第一層爲13.8m×10.8m，第二層爲5.1m×4.65m。正殿中心部分圍有寬3米的回廊，沿其外壁，排列著約有2.1米的巨大坐佛，手結定印。現還殘留著那些台座、手、腳。而本圖所示的頭部，不是在像與像間的前方，而是落在空間稍寬的後方，才得以保留下來。這是斯坦因發掘的五身當中的第三尊。
佛頭本身沒有任何提示確切年代的證據，但從斯坦因所記述的以下種種特徵，能夠推算它的年代。即蓋在佛像膝蓋上的衣紋線，是從兩手垂下的三條衣褶的集合點，此是犍陀羅式的。佛像其中的兩身上約有2.5釐米寬的粗褶子，包括本像在內的三身像上，有兩條狹窄的溝狀褶子，殘留著與熱瓦克出土的塑像群相似的紅色痕迹等。另外，更明確的證據是，還可舉出圍繞寺院部位的印度、波斯風格的灰泥壁柱形狀。它們具備犍陀羅的特徵，後又向安得悅和喀達里克見到的形式發展的。對米蘭寺院遺迹的年代判斷上，最具決定性的證據是，梵文貝葉的發現。那是用笈多王朝早期的婆羅謎文寫的，不可能晚於5世紀以後。另外，從完全沒有發現吐蕃文資料這一點上也應得到證實（與安得悅和喀達里克發現大量吐蕃文書形成對比）。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

Beside him is a damaged, similar but standing figure in a mannered posture with hands once joined. Five more or less half-length figures look on or throw flowers, some with chignons on the side of the head, one with a cross-hatched turban and floral crest. Paired grooves for drapery folds are common.
The trapezoidal compartment has moulded borders. Above, a modified dentil-and-drop or bead-and-reel moulding is surmounted by a register of clusters of knotted acanthus leaves with opening lotuses rising out of them and separated by half-rosettes enclosed in a border.
The middle compartment shows an enthroned Bodhisattva flanked by figures; the two on draped seats wear cross-hatched crested turbans, the usual ornaments and uttarīya and paridhāna. Beside them are smaller, similarly dressed figures, with collars and coiled chignons; all join their hands and their feet rest on footstools. Behind them stand more such figures, two framed in the canopy of the throne. The Bodhisattva raises his hand in abhaya at 45 degrees and forward from the body; he holds a water pot and wears only a collar, bracelets and earrings as ornaments, uttarīya and paridhāna, and his chignon is secured by a band. Though full, his long face is also angular with open, almost staring eyes. The throne has turned legs and drapery, broken pillars supporting a flat canopy with a series of small festoons and tufts projecting at the sides. The curved and projecting borders have two registers of sawtooth enrichment and, on each side, a volute formed by a beaked head and neck. A framed register of stellate petals spans the top.
In the top compartment, now incomplete, a now headless Buddha turns to his right towards two standing figures with uttarīya and no ornaments; one joins his hands, the nearer perhaps once extended a hand towards the Buddha. On his left are a kneeling figure, the raised knee towards the Buddha, and another, half-length in an uttarīya, both damaged.
In the tympanum is a sea-monster (panther) with a curled tail, once presumably worshipping a figure or cult object at the top with one or more corresponding figures beyond it (compare BM 1902.1002.23). The border on the surviving side has a sawtooth enrichment and a voluted beaked head above a pendent bunch of grapes.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese

正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。

觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

Having dismissed Chandaka and Kaṇṭhaka and cut off his hair, the Bodhisattva, wishing to adopt more suitable garments, exchanged his Benares silk for the rougher clothes of a hunter.While the Tonsure may occur before the Farewell from the horse (Buddhacarita, Saṃghabhedavastu, Mahāvastu), the adoption of rough clothing, although in some accounts previous to the departure of the groom and horse (Buddhacarita, Jātaka Introduction), is the Bodhisattva's last act in this sequence of events. The Tonsure appears to occur only once in Gandhāra, on a limestone relief from Qunduz where the order of events is: the Farewell, the Tonsure and the Exchange of Clothing (Fischer, 1958: 238, fig. 4).

The robe shows dense folds, mainly in ridges, and below the loop in the Buddha's raised left hand gathered drapery spreads down to the seat. The head is in high relief with open, slightly slanting eyes. The uṣṇīṣa is bound by a fillet and the halo has a border formed by an inner groove.

A cult of the turban should presuppose the story of the Bodhisattva's tonsure after the Great Departure. With a sword he cut off his locks (cudā), or locks together with a crest or turban (moli and cūḷāmaṇiveṭhana), crown (mukuṭa) or Mani pearl gem which were taken by Indra and honoured among the Thirty-Three Gods. The ascension, enshrinement and worship of a turban are found on sculpture outside Gandhāra, and in Gandhāra a turban, shown apparently as a cult object, is a persistent motif in sculpture. While the episode of the tonsure itself is scarcely represented in Gandhāra, the turban is brought to the Bodhisattva as he leaves the palace and occurs exceptionally as part of the Exchange of Clothing and when Chandaka returns with it to Kapilavastu.
The present piece may show the Bodhisattva or the Buddha instructing a deity in the worship of the turban or it may have some connection with concepts of royal consecration (abhiṣeka) and more specifically as extended to the final stage of a Bodhisattva's ascent, known also by the term abhiṣeka.

They are all seen as representing the converted yakṣa Āṭavika returning, in the bowl and to the Buddha, the child he had been about to devour while the child's parent still grieves for its fate.

Beneath, a kneeling elephant, with a cloth on its back, holds in its trunk a parasol by the shaft.

To distinguish between compositions with the three wheels (an innovation confined to Gandhāra) as cult object and as symbolising the First Sermon, Foucher, 1905-51: I, 427-31, proposed that the presence of deer, even when flanking and worshipping monks are standing and kneeling rather than seated, indicated the latter, but instances are now known which may favour grouping scenes with the three wheels, but lacking the deer, more closely with the cycle of the First Sermon. This may appear from Taxila Kn. '32-302, an incomplete panel apparently in the usual iconography but without deer (Marshall, 1951: n, 717-18, no. 119, III, pl. 220, no. 119), from the apparently narrative context provided by a harmikā and from single panels among which the Buddha himself may stand beside the three wheels and in many cases turns or touches another wheel or disc, while monks bring a seat as on BM 1940.0713.4 in connection with BM 1914.0502.1. Also common are the simultaneous representation of the three wheels and a single wheel or floral disc in the combination of 'trident' over disc, and here deer are also sporadically present.
The symbolism of the three wheels has been explained by Benisti, 1977, 65-6, with textual references, not as the Three jewels of Buddhism but as an allusion to the three turnings of the wheel at the First Sermon. In the many different examples of scenes with the three wheels, the meaning may seem to vary between a representation of the Doctrine in its First Sermon aspect and one which is more rather than less narrative, with the Buddha present and turning or touching a wheel or disc and sometimes a monk bringing a seat. In both cases the monks are worshippers instead of auditors.

The haloed Buddha sits in dhyāna, his over-robe with its grooved and ridged folds covering both shoulders, the curved neckline in relief and the lower edges lying over the right arm and leg; the robe forms a semi-circle between the legs beside the gathered drapery which spreads onto the ground from the left wrist. The damaged oval head has wavy hair and a large uṣṇīṣa, and the eyes are long and narrow with prominent lids. In contrast to the numerous small surrounding figures the Buddha looks monumental.
The cave has gently lobed sides and the landscape is in four registers, one below and three flanking the cave. In the lowest are turbaned figures in uttarīya and the usual ornaments, standing in various postures, looking up, joining hands, carrying flowers and an offering; one figure wears a chignon instead of a turban, and the kneeling figure with a necklace and cylindrical cap on the right appears to be Indra. The harpist Pañcaśikha is the second turbaned figure from the left in the bottom register, one leg awkwardly flexed, holding a harp in his left hand and a plectrum in his right. At both ends of the register an elephant protome, where undamaged, wears ornamental bands and holds flowers in its trunk; behind Indra is the curving stem of a flowering plant.
On the lowest register beside the cave, between plants, Vajrapāṇi sits on the left, probably bearded, with musculature indicated on the chest and arm, a damaged vajra against his right shoulder, a robe draped across the knees and with a worshipping and ornamented turbaned figure beside him. On the right of the cave a seated, ornamented and turbaned figure holding a spear, wearing a sleeved and girt knee-length tunic, one hand like Vajrapāṇi's on his knee and with a similar worshipping figure beside him, is also between plants. On the next register three figures balanced on each side turn towards the Buddha, four with hands joined, two holding garlands, two kneeling and all with turbans and uttarīya.

Three haloed broad-chested Buddhas sit frontally on rectangular seats, two in dhyāna and one in abhaya. The over-robes of all three form the common semi-circular edge on the seat and have the fall of gathered drapery on the left spreading to lie flat; while the edge of the over-robe runs in the usual way over the right forearm in the abhaya gesture, the over-robe of the two figures in dhyāna completely covers the right thigh and knee of the Buddha on the right and only partly the thigh of the Buddha on the left. The drapery folds are everywhere defined by paired grooves. The abhaya hand is lost, those in dhyāna seem very large. The faces are oval and full, the wavy hair drawn back into the uṣṇīṣa. The seats are strewn with grass, and have plinths and patterned faces.
From right to left, the first Buddha is attended by a damaged monk and separated from the next Buddha by a youthful Vajrapāṇi standing with legs crossed at the ankles towards the second Buddha but turning from the waist upwards towards the first, one hand on hip, the other holding what was a long vajra from hip to shoulder. His straight hair curls on the shoulders, his chest is modelled and his loincloth bulges over the genitals. Beside the second Buddha a monk stands with his head turned towards the Bodhisattva, his robe in paired grooves for folds, his right shoulder bare, his damaged right hand appearing to hold a flower (lotus or lotuses) above the shoulder while his left holds what may be a long thick stalk curving over the shoulder, though the condition of the stone above it reveals little. The haloed and turbaned Bodhisa-ttva, seated with legs crossed below the knees on a cylindrical cane stool and wearing an uttarīya and paridhāna with pointed ends, is badly damaged; his left lower arm, which seems awkwardly reattached, may have been in the pensive gesture and connected with a small projection on the halo above. The next Vajrapāṇi, in close fitting knee-length tunic with some swallow-tail folds, stands almost frontally, the vajra vertical against his left shoulder and his right hand holding the bottom of a stalk; a damaged projection above the shoulder may be the lost flower(s). The folds of the tunic curve concentrically with the neck and a flap hangs from the left shoulder.

Drapery folds on all the figures and the wings of the spirits or kiṃnaras show dense grooves which recall the early 'drawing' style of Butkara. 
In a number of instances a disc, radiate or plain, receives worship in a context where the cult object is often an attribute such as the Buddha's turban or bowl. Occurring on caitya arch friezes or over the upper compartment of false gables, these cases have encouraged the interpretation, extended to a Mathurā panel, that the disc, in order to qualify as attribute of Buddha, should be a halo. But discs occur in a more varied range of examples and many appear rather to symbolise the Buddha himself, especially in connection with events of the First Sermon. Thus the present scene becomes more probably an episode from that cycle; some examples, as if the force of the symbol is insufficient, show a pair of knees behind the disc, yet others the disc with the Buddha also, and yet others again a disc with another symbol, such as the three wheels or a tree.
For the disc as the Buddha's halo see Pal, 1984: 139, and Carter, 1988b: 29. A proposal to identify the disc as a solar symbol of the Buddha is based on a sky- and fire-symbolism connected with concepts of ascent and personal liberation (Enlightenment), return and salvation (First Sermon).",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Green schist, broken, chipped and worn.

After the passage of the two merchants the Buddha, thinking the Doctrine too profound, hesitated to propagate it, but in his compassion resolved to do so if asked by the crested Mahābrahmā or Śikhī and inspired him accordingly. Śikhī  invited Indra to join him in supplication and they, with the four mahārājas or lokapālas and other gods of various heavens, went to the Buddha who, after hesitations and repeated requests, finally consented. Mahāvastu III.314-20 tells substantially the same story without naming the Mahābrahmā further while the parallel story ibid.: I.230 makes a Mahābrahmā the only supplicant in Dīpaṃkara's case; Brahmā is the principal supplicant in Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra (Lamotte, 1944-80: I, 57-60) and is alone in Saṃghabhedavastu I.129. In the Pāli tradition the Mahābrahmā Sahampati is the only supplicant. In the Jātaka Introduction (Fausboll, 1877-97: I, 81, translated Rhys Davids, 1925: 206-7) he is accompanied by many gods but he is alone in canonical accounts (Malalasekara, i960: II, 1080 s.v. Sahampati with references).

The first, incomplete scene shows part of the Birth with Māyā's arm raised to a branch, Indra leaning forward under a barrel drum and behind him a figure raising his hand to his mouth and the other over his head. In the next scene the haloed infant Bodhisattva stands under a parasol on an indistinct, perhaps lotus pedestal and is held, on each side, by a kneeling woman while Indra and Brahmā hold inverted narrow-necked pots over him.

Lamotte, 1944-80: III, 1343-4 (fn- 3) lists with references, also to the monuments, five forms of the literary tradition of the Bodhisattva's Bath before or after the Seven Steps: 1. A hot and cold stream of water falling from the sky; 2. The same but of terrestrial origin; 3. The same produced by the serpent kings Nanda and Upananda in the sky with Indra, Brahmā, the four lokapālas and other deities who bathe and sprinkle the Bodhisattva with variously perfumed waters and flowers; 4. The order inverted with Indra and Brahmā in the sky, bathing and sprinkling, followed by the serpent kings associated with the two streams and assisted by many other gods; 5. The serpent kings alone bathe the Bodhisattva with perfumed waters.
Representations of the Bodhisattva's Bath in Gandhāra usually agree in giving the child central position, under a parasol and often on a form of tripod stand and haloed, Brahmā (left) viewed from the back, and Indra (right) with inverted water pot to each side, while a flanking female may stand or kneel beside the child. Additional flanking deities of Brahmā and Indra type also occur. Panels of this subject showing wholly ophiomorphic nagas are very rarely reported.

His emaciation is emphasised by a sharp re-entrant angle below the ribcage. Balancing the half-length ascetic opposite is another figure, of youthful appearance, emerging from behind the hut.

The carving is everywhere summary and the figures are crude; few details are altogether certain. The old ṛṣi Asita, who lived in the Himalaya with his nephew Naradatta, on perceiving signs that the Bodhisattva had been born, predicted to Naradatta the child's destiny as Buddha or cakravartin. They then went to Kapilavastu; Śuddhodana brought the child and Asita examined him and held him in his lap, weeping at the realisation that he would not live to benefit spiritually from the child's certain Buddhahood. The Pāli tradition is very similar.
The presentation of the infant Bodhisattva to Asita follows the formula of the Interpretation of the Dream (see BM 1931.0711.1) and shares variations with it; in the presentation, however, together with an old ascetic who, unlike the old man in the Interpretation, is properly Asita, seated to the left and with his youthful attendant or nephew Naradatta behind, an infant must be present and Asita usually holds it; the seated parents make various gestures and a figure stands in between, holding the infant or presumably just having done so. Altogether exceptional here are the figures with water pot and branch, attributes regularly associated with the Birth; if the parents were ever present, they must have been on the preceding panel on the stupa drum. 
The elephant in this unusual combination may be explained by reference to the Youth cycle: when the now youthful Bodhisattva is about to show his martial skills, a large white elephant is brought to Kapilavastu and Devadatta kills it out of jealousy.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/dc9b/s1),,"1.Grey schist, broken, worn and cracked.

He has a fleshy chest and is carved, at least above the waist, in greater relief and on a larger scale than the other figures.
The hut is a cubic structure with a high arched roof covered with a leaf pattern and surmounted horizontally along its ridge by a hemi-cylindrical element supporting a large bird; it seems double-roofed like the structures underlying the false gable panel (compare BM 1880.219) but with the upper part unusually small. The front has a plain vertical face and at the back the curved lower roof is plain also.

The story of this scene survives in the Chinese canon and was first published in this context by Foucher in a translation by Chavannes. A king of Candravatī, his mind poisoned by the jealousy of his other wives, caused his pregnant youngest wife to be killed and buried. A posthumous son, however, nourished himself from one breast on a half of his mother's corpse not decomposed; when he was three the collapse of part of the tomb released him, and when he was six he met the Buddha and became an arhat. Subsequently he saw and converted his own father and the Buddha revealed their relationship, explaining the recent events from an earlier series in the time of a previous Buddha. The child's name, Sudāya, is restored from the Chinese both in this narrative and in another version, where a pregnant mother dies, is buried in a tomb, gives birth and the child feeds on her milk for seven years before meeting the Buddha and becoming an arhat.
The naked child standing and kneeling is Sudāya, who thus appears in this example, as in others, in continuous narration crouching beside the corpse of his mother and standing before the Buddha; he can also appear only once, beside his mother or standing.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist with crystalline inclusions, broken and exfoliated.

In the complete scene the Buddha is seated centrally, on a damaged draped seat with turned legs, in abhaya and securing the over-robe in the left hand while gathered drapery spreads below it. Leafy branches spread outward beside his unhaloed head. To his right a figure in uttarīya and with a small top-knot or chignon on a shaven head holds, in his left hand, a skull with a large eye cavity visible, while his right hand, with a bracelet, palm inwards and fingers curled towards the thumb, is held in front. Two figures converse beside him, one with curly hair and a chignon, the other turbaned; both wear an uttarīya, a collar and earrings. The latter raises one hand and may hold flowers in the other. To the Buddha's left a monk, with one shoulder bare and shaven head with a hairline, holds in the left hand a damaged object, no doubt, on the evidence of parallels, once a skull; he raises his right hand with the index and middle fingers joined.

This piece belongs to a group first recognised by Taddei (J979: 395-420) in which a central Buddha is flanked on his right by a brāhmaṇa with topknot emerging from his wrapped head and, opposite, by a monk, each holding a skull; in his examples the brāhmaṇa consistently holds his right hand as here but the Buddha's gesture varies and in one case the facing monk is replaced by a lay figure without a skull. A shaven head with a topknot occurs only on the above.
The underlying story was quoted by Taddei from the Pāli. It tells of a  brāhmaṇa who, by tapping the skulls of the dead, could determine in which destination they had been reborn. In the Buddha's presence he correctly identified four rebirths, but could say nothing about the skull of an arhat and he therefore joined the Order to learn the secret. In a comparable account in Sanskrit the skull-tapper is the son of a ṛṣi and an antelope and, having a head like an antelope's, is called Mṛgaśiras; Ānanda puts him to the test with four skulls and, when he fails over the last, an arhat's skull, brings him before the Buddha who explains that the liberated have no destination; he becomes a monk and attains nirvāṇa when the Buddha demonstrates the uncertainty of life as demonstrated by the monk's inaccurate predictions of rain.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and chipped.

(Object),,,"Panel showing perhaps the departing Viśvaṃtara making a gift. A damaged chariot drawn by two horses holds three persons and the much taller, haloed Bodhisattva. Two figures are badly sliced: at the back is presumably Madrī with what looks like a loop of hair and a flower in the wreath headdress; the middle figure seems to hold the reins with one hand while the other is raised to the top of the head in astonishment; and the third, complete and male, with the ends of the hair waved or rolled over the forehead, and wearing an earring, collar and armlet, stands forward in the chariot with one hand raised to the top of the head and the other holding a bag of treasure for the Bodhisattva to give to the brāhmaṇa.
The Bodhisattva, leaning forward at an angle expressing his eagerness to give, wears armlets, bracelets, collar, earrings and long hair with a chignon at the top and bound back by a fillet. His left hand grasps an indistinct object, perhaps a small bag, while his right hand is raised and stretched out holding a damaged narrow object. It descends indistinguishably into the brāhmaṇa's outstretched hand where it may be interpreted as cascading from an emptying bag. The ascetic is the largest figure, and his head is bowed beneath the upper frame. He wears a girdled paridhāna with paired drapery folds and his long hair is drawn back and raised into a high chignon. His body is supported on a stick and his emaciated side is densely grooved to show a rib cage above the thrust-out abdomen. The eyes are large with big lids, the nose sharply cut and the mouth an asymmetrical line, making the face look wholly ungracious. The centre of the action is emphasised by the undercutting of both forearms.
Behind him, almost frontal, is a young ascetic, the legs crossed below the knees. He has long hair with a chignon, a girdled lower garment, a brāhmaṇa's sacrificial thread, a water pot in his left hand and the right raised to shoulder level, showing the palm below curled fingers. Like the small figure
on the chariot his eyes show a distinct and heavy-lidded treatment which, with the rolled ends of the hair and perhaps paired drapery folds, suggests late and post-Gandhāra work.
The chariot appears to have trellised openwork sides and its large wheel partly emerges behind the nearer horse, which stands exposed along its full length facing the action while the other, inner horse seems to turn to face the viewer. Both are harnessed, the nearer horse with a saddle; the girth, breast-plate and crupper are beaded, the two latter adorned with radiate 'phalerae' or discs; bells hang at the front and the reins are undercut below the mouths. One mane is dressed into a short comb, the other is more abundant. The nearer horse's flat flank emphasises the compressed carving within a restricted space.
On the framing pilasters a haloed meditating Buddha on a lotus seat survives at the front and on both sides of the shaft; the capitals are tall, and the scored base appears to have two plinths.

The story ends happily in the reunion of the family without any loss of merit gained by such sacrifices.

The haloed Buddha, no doubt formerly in the centre of the broken panel and on a very low rectangular seat, his right shoulder bare, an undergarment visible on the right chest, holds his hands in the teaching gesture, the fingers of the left hand touching the bottom of the right hand. His robe has a grooved and paired representation of drapery folds and gathered drapery hangs from his left wrist to spread beside the semi-circular edge between the knees. His head is almost round, the face rather broad and the eyes open and sharply cut; the hair runs in undulating lines into the large uṣṇīṣa from a peak over the forehead above a slightly proud, circular ūrṇā. A rough broken projection on the uṣṇīṣa may be from foliage of a lost tree; the halo is nowhere indicated on the Buddha's right.
The strewn rectangular seat has a simple plinth and on the face diagonally bisected panels forming triangles, each containing a small indented triangle. Before the seat a serpent, the body marked with circles and coiled three times, raises its head with protruding tongue to the Buddha. Seated on identical rectangular seats at an oblique angle to the Buddha two monks, both sharp-featured and with open eyes, their robes over both shoulders forming a raised and sharp neckline and with drapery folds as on the Buddha, hold their covered hands in meditation while the robe beneath lies as if spread under the legs.

A certain nāga's prospect of salvation depended on a Buddha coming into the world and he therefore devised a set of questions which only a Buddha could answer. When this happened he paid homage to the Buddha first 'in his own natural body' and then as 'a Manava youth'.
For this story in continuous narration on the Prasenajit Pillar at Bhārhut see Bachhofer, 1929: I, pl. 23 (letterpress with the Chinese story) and Luders, 1963: pl. XXXIX, where the nāga or serpent appears three times, twice in human form with a five-headed serpent rising over his head and once as a five-headed serpent. Representations in Gandhāra fall into a number of types. One shows the nāga kneeling before the Buddha in human form while behind him, in a fenced tank, a figure with joined hands may have a serpent rising behind it. Perhaps this is a case of continuous narration with the same nāga in serpent and human form or, as Foucher believes, the nāga as human and his daughter still in serpent form and in the tank.
Another type shows the serpent in animal form before the Buddha's seat and in human form to the Buddha's far right (Peshawar I7I6) beyond seated monks. The lost left side of the present piece prevents it from being grouped with Peshawar 1716 where continuous narration presumably explains the two forms of the nāga. A third version (Bombay 22), without monks, shows a nāga in human form directly to the Buddha's right, as serpent before his throne, while an ascetic with a damaged water pot stands on his left; this distribution may recur on the damaged Bombay 21 (AIIS 131-68) where a serpent appears below the Buddha's seat and an ascetic with a water pot stands on his left, but none of the other figures now shows the attached serpent.

(Object),,,"Panel showing the Offering of Dust. The haloed Buddha, filling the height of the scene, turns looking sideways and down and leaning somewhat forward, his right hand and arm stretched out before him, palm inwards, while the left hand holds an empty bowl sideways and open to the viewer. The over-robe covering both shoulders with a high, slightly pointed neckline hangs with edges in relief from the right forearm and in a dense fall from the left wrist, and reveals more of the lower undergarment but less of the upper than is usual. The drapery folds are regular and densely rounded ridges. The hair undulates into the large uṣṇīṣa. Beneath the bowl a standing child, almost naked save for a cloak round the neck and hanging down the back, a low girdle, bracelets and anklets, wears earrings and a fillet above his short border of curls and holds out both hands on which apparently lies a flat cake. Beside him another similar child, naked except for ornaments, hair with a low chignon, sits cross-legged on a moulded threshold or plinth with damaged hands joined.
Above the standing child are two half-length turbaned figures, one above the other, both wearing ornaments and an uttarīya. Also on the threshold and framed in an oblique and fasciated doorway with a hint of sloping jambs stands a woman wearing a diaphanous sleeved blouse, a garment over her left shoulder and a paridhāna round it, a cross-hatched wreath-and-large-flower headdress with a loop of hair projecting above it, and the usual ornaments; instead of the palm branch she holds peacock feathers in a cylindrical mount upright in her left hand while her damaged right hand is raised. The lintel is enriched with a sawtooth pattern under a cavetto cornice of vertically grooved lotus petals and above it is a balcony draped in a textile. On the balcony are two women like the one below, one raising an arm to throw flowers. While the oblique doorway may suggest a variation of depth, the balcony is entirely frontal and the threshold almost so.
Beside the Buddha a Vajrapāṇi of Hermes type, with one flexed leg, turns away towards a monk; he is naked except for a draped overgarment looping below the plump thighs and revealing an otherwise svelte figure with modelled chest, one damaged arm raised, the other cupped under the rounded bottom of his vajra. His hair is short with corkscrew curls below the fillet. The monk's tonsure shows a hairline, the over-robe covers both shoulders, his right hand is covered, the other resting on the chest. A similar monk is above him and above Vajrapāṇi is a half-length ornamented celestial with wavy hair and a chignon, holding thumb and index finger of the left hand to the mouth in wonder while the right arm is raised, the thumb, index and middle fingers joined and pointing upwards.

Jaya gave him a handful of dust, calling it (coarsely ground) meal, while Vijaya expressed approval by joining his hands; on Jaya's pronouncing an aspiration (praṇidhāna) to universal monarchy, the Buddha predicted his rebirth one day as the emperor Aśoka.

The fragmentary scene on the right shows part of the Buddha's couch, a turned leg and the Buddha's head and right shoulder, his head against a plain halo and resting, beside his hand, on a pillow. The Buddha's face is very indistinct under wavy hair and the uṣṇīṣa. Below the bed a prostrate grieving figure raises an arm from the elbow. Beside the head of the bed Indra stands, under a tree, in three-quarter view wearing a low and ornamented cylindrical cap, an earring, a collar and an uttarīya in the narrow mode. He holds one hand to the side of his head, fingers on the forehead and thumb to the ear in what may be a pensive gesture. A tall figure next to him in uttarīya, collar, earring, bracelet and turban joins damaged hands.
In the next scene a stupa on a rectangular base has columns at the four corners, those at the back indicated by repeating in low relief the capital elements only. On the side of the base, above the plinth, is a diaper of four-petalled flowers, while the columns have plain shafts under flattened globular capital elements horizontally grooved. The two large drums, the upper drum set back above the lower, are enriched with acanthus and support a dome with a barely visible false gable panel on the side, a vedikā register at the bottom, and a lotus with stamens above. The damaged harmikā is surmounted by a tapering spire of four parasols and a finial with pleated banners on either side. Beside the stupa are worshippers in crested turban, ornaments, uttarīya and paridhāna; the farthest from the stupa is holding a reliquary, while the two beside it join their hands. Vestiges of a tree remain on the left.
The stupa in this context is commonly represented with two or four persons: they may be layfolk, layfolk and monks or monks only. They normally join their hands and sometimes several carry relic caskets, although the legend requires one deposit only to a stupa.
The scenes are separated by a double frame enclosing a column with a Corinthian capital, a base like a squat pot on a plinth and a narrow band round the shaft. The cornice consists, under a fascia with sawtooth enrichment, of squat, vertically grooved brackets of simplified horizontal ""S"" shaped pattern type with an acanthus capital and based on a panel with an acanthus pattern on the soffit (compare BM 1888.0806.1 with references).

This scene may represent the story of Bāvarī's sixteen pupils or Pārāyaṇika brāhmaṇas. An ascetic named Bāvarī, distressed on account of a curse, was consoled by a female spirit and sent sixteen of his disciples with their following to test the Buddha's Buddhahood by certain questions, and they duly became arhats; the Buddha then appeared before Bāvarī, who also became an arhat.
A number of sculptures have been referred to this story; a mountainous context is common to most, which either situate the Buddha in a cave, as in the Visit of Indra, or on an uneven rocky surface, and the ascetics adopt mannered and indeed dejected postures; the gesture of touching the head, which here suggests a salutation, seems elsewhere like burying the head in one hand. For the presence of guardian figures see Raducha, 1985a, who considers that BM 1965.0801.5 may have a connection with this subject.
A previous explanation of this scene, the preaching of the Sermon on the Senses to the Kāśyapas after their conversion, was proposed for this panel on account of the mountainous setting and its possible equation with Gayāsīrṣa (Gayāsisa). The ascetic appearance of the Kāśyapas after their conversion would be anachronistic, but for a comparable problem in respect of BM 1899.0609.21 see Foucher, 1905-51: II, 274-5.; Zwalf 1985
Seated on a hill, the Buddha may be preaching to some of his first converts, the Kāśyapa hermits, still shown long-haired. In the Pali tradition the Buddha is said to have addressed them, after they had become monks, on Mount Gayā (Gayāśīrṣa). 'Everything is burning . . . with the fire of lust. . . of anger . . . of ignorance. . . . Considering this . . . becoming weary of all that [the disciple] divests himself of passion ... is made free. . . .

Connected accounts of the conception or dream of Māyā generally agree in representing Queen Māyā as sleeping and her husband as absent. The Bodhisattva, seen in a dream as an elephant who enters her womb, is superb and white and sometimes six-tusked. The question whether Indian sculptural traditions saw the descent of the Bodhisattva in the form of an elephant as dream or as physical reality has been discussed with reference to the varying testimony of the texts.; Zwalf 1985
The conception of the historical Buddha took place when his mother, Māyā, consort of the Śākya chief Śuddhodana, saw in a dream a white elephant enter her right side.

The suggestion that this panel represents the Presentation of the Bride to the Bodhisattva is recorded without contradiction or enthusiasm by Marshall.

In the Mahāvastu account (II.I 59-64) the Bodhisattva, repelled by the sleeping women, asked Chandaka for his horse and left despite his pleas; no one woke, the gods rained flowers, the earth trembled and the four mahārājas held up Kaṇṭhaka's hooves while Supratiṣṭhita the yakṣa, with his five hundred companions, opened a city gate; wicked Māra grieved, hosts of nāgas and suparṇas escorted the Bodhisattva who, before the sorrowing city-goddess, swore not to reenter the town before his Enlightenment. In the longer Lalitavistara account deities, in a preamble, prepared their various parts and Vaiśravaṇa in particular told the yakṣas to carry the horse's feet while he went ahead, and Indra undertook to open doors and point the way. The gods then showed the women in repellent attitudes and the Bodhisattva, seeing the gods and planets ready, summoned Chandaka; despite his pleas the horse was brought, the city and his wife plunged in sleep, the four mahādrājas and the Trāyastriṃśa gods appeared, Indra and Brahmā showed the way (v. 80) and the city-goddess's lament elicited the same vow (vv.82-93). In the Pāli jātaka Introduction the Bodhisattva looked at his wife and new-born son in the next room before mounting; deities, placing their palms under the hooves, muffled their sound, Channa followed, the deity of the city gate opened it and Māra's dissuasion proved in vain.
Departure scenes fall into two main groups, with frontal departure as above and with horse and rider in profile as on 1939.0119.16; the latter may be varied with a three-quarter view as on 1913.1108.2. Departures in profile go from right to left with a gateway behind the rider. A horizontal Departure cycle on a large scale has been proposed for a building not a stupa at Butkara I.
The frequently armoured figure, often with sword or bow, conducting the rider or pointing the way, either with hand held open or with wand or staff, has been identified as Māra who, in the Jātaka Introduction, attempts to halt the course to Enlightenment, Indra or Vaiśravaṇa; Foucher explains the other armed figures as the five hundred Śākya youths guarding each of the gates of Kapilavastu against the Bodhisattva's departure. The figure with a parasol, usually beside and behind the Bodhisattva, may be Chandaka; the figures emerging from the ground or complete above it and holding the horses' hooves to muffle them are yakṣas except where one or two female figures, identified as the earth-goddess, are recognised, Vajrapāṇi is first seen in this Bodhisattva's career on scenes of the Great Departure and the desponding female with mural crown often leaning her elbow on a post of moulded or architectural form is the nagaradevatā or city-goddess of Kapilavastu.

The execution has many distinctive features: the pronounced and expressively angular form of the bodies; their contorted postures; their compression in sometimes flattened planes within the panel; the slight inclination of the columnar stone in the centre and the Buddha's sloping posture, both of which suggest that the Buddha is arresting its fall. The narrow, sometimes slanting eyes and the hairstyle are reminiscent of features that seem to be in a late style and the similarity of this panel with BM 1913.1108.21 is suggestive, given the same donor, of an identity of workshop and site.
Devadatta's murder attempts are summarised below. At the first attempt Devadatta sent men at intervals and in increasing numbers, whom the Buddha successively converted. At the second attempt Devadatta hurled down a great stone, but a yakṣa intercepted it and only a fragment injured the Buddha. Then Devadatta persuaded mahouts to loose Nālāgiri, a fierce elephant, but the Buddha's compassion halted its assault and the elephant paid him reverence.
In the Mūlasarvāstivādin Vinaya, Devadatta's first attempt was to have an engineer set up a contrivance worked by five hundred men to kill the Buddha and arranged for yet others to kill him if it failed; the mechanics repented and, before setting off the contrivance, descended to the Buddha by magic steps and were converted. Trying again with fresh assistants, Devadatta shot a stone from the catapult; Vajrapāṇi shattered it and the yakṣa Kumbhīra lost his life trying to stop a fragment injuring the Buddha's foot.
Foucher's original assumption of a wall separating the Buddha and his would-be assassins, generally adopted although textually unsupported, was first challenged by Hargreaves, 1924-5: 150-3, who proposed to recognise the second attempt only and a stone instead of Foucher's wall. Subsequently Foucher, 1905-51: II, 848 ad 541, proposed to see in representations with his wall, which he now too considered a rock, a combination of the first and second attempts of the general tradition and, in Calcutta G. 10/A23281 and perhaps this example, the Buddha trying to steady a stone; Taddei, 1963a: 40-1, quoting both Hargreaves and Foucher's recantation of 1951, would rather see a 'heavy square stone or pillar' whose fall the Buddha stops than a real wall which in Gandhāra is always shown frontally. Moreover both Hargreaves and Taddei illustrate carvings where the same type of columnar stone or pillar is being manoeuvred into position, not only by itself but also, and evidently in continuous narration, with the more usual representation of the murder attempt with the Buddha beside an upright stone or pillar. While those panels where a stone is being manoeuvred seem close to the catapult story, the representation of the Buddha with the stone and the murderers is less so, for they abandoned their contrivance and descended the mountain by a stair before their conversion; a variant or continuous narration must be assumed.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and worn.

The panel is one of a small group showing a humped bull at the Buddha's feet and, where clear, licking them; a figure apparently its herd or owner and, in two cases at least, a figure offering a purse. This group has been referred by Santoro in two articles first to the Chinese version of a lost Indian original and subsequently to the Divyāvadāna. In the Chinese a bull being led to slaughter ran towards the Buddha, fell weeping at his feet and begged to be saved; the Buddha explained that formerly, as a cakravartin, on encountering a man taken up for debt he had offered double repayment to release him. The money was never paid until, in his present rebirth as a bull, when his purchase price equalled the value of the debt, the Buddha, with the help of Indra, Brahmā and the four mahārājas, offered his owner treasure to fill two bull-hides; the bull came away with the Buddha and in a following human rebirth became destined for nirvana. The Divyāvadāna tells of a bull which, while being led out of Vaiśālī to the slaughter by a butcher, broke his bonds, ran towards the Buddha, knelt and licked his feet; despite the Buddha's urging, the butcher, pleading poverty, refused to spare him until the Buddha, with the help of Indra, provided three times the bull's value.
Santoro (1990), proposing, where Indra does not hold the purse, to see the lokapāla Kubera-Vaiśravaṇa, perhaps justified by the Chinese, does not commit herself to either story and discusses problems raised by ambivalent figural evidence.
For the ambiguous history of this piece see BM 1912.1221.1.; Zwalf 1985
This panel shows a humped bull licking the Buddha's feet, the Buddha's guardian spirit Vajrapāṇi, with thunderbolt, and a turbaned worshipper; a figure crowned like the god Indra offers a bag, perhaps ransom for the bull, to a man with an implement who may be its owner or a herdsman. A panel in Peshawar Museum also shows a humped bull licking the Buddha's feet and attendant figures but no transaction as suggested above. These scenes may be versions of an episode found in a text which makes a characteristic Buddhist point. A monk, who had once abused his hearers for their stupidity by calling them buffaloes, was reborn a buffalo with an ungovernable temper. On seeing the Buddha, however, he fell at his feet and licked them, so gaining a happier lot in his next existence.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The encounter with the nāgarāja Kālika occurred on the way to the bodhi tree, when the splendour from the Bodhisattva's body illumined Kālika's palace and Kālika spoke verses foretelling the inevitability of the Enlightenment; Kālika's wife, Suvarṇaprabhāsā, along with serpent maidens, showered the Bodhisattva with flowers, jewels and so on, and also spoke verses of praise. In the Pāli tradition the nāgarāja Kāla hears the Bodhisattva throw a bowl into the Nerañjarā and, as it strikes the bowls of previous Buddhas, praises him and predicts the Enlightenment. The present subject and the Submission of Apalāla can be represented with a similar iconography (see 214, Lahore 1057) when the nāga couple appear in an enclosed pool or spring, but the Apalāla subject is usually distinguished by a second Vajrapāṇi in a posture of assault or menace against the nāgas and the Buddha may appropriately be accompanied by monks; for the Kālika subject fenced enclosures seem usual, while Apalāla can appear on rocks, in water and so on.

After the seven weeks' meditation and fasting that followed the Enlightenment, a large caravan belonging to two merchants called Trapuṣa and Bhallika was suddenly stopped in its tracks when it approached the neighbourhood of the tree under which the Buddha was. When they had seen him, the two merchants offered food, the four mahārājas each brought a stone bowl and the Buddha caused the bowls to become one, leaving only lines below the rim to show that there had been more bowls. After the merchants had made the profession of faith in himself and the Doctrine and in the future Order, the Buddha gave them cuttings from his hair and nails as relics.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and chipped.

Once clear of Kapilavastu, the Bodhisattva handed his jewels and parasol to Chandaka, cut off his hair and bade the groom and the horse depart. The horse licked his feet, but the Bodhisattva went away, paying no attention. In the Buddhacarita the horse licked the Bodhisattva's feet, shed tears and received consoling words, and in the Saṃghabhedavastu he licked the Bodhisattva's feet, was stroked and consolingly spoken to. The Lalitavistara speaks of a stupa to mark the dismissal, otherwise briefly reported, and while the Pāli tradition of the Jātaka Introduction tells of Kaṇṭhaka's death of grief at the place of parting, in Sanskrit accounts Kaṇṭhaka died of the same cause later and the return of horse and groom to Kapilavastu is recorded in sculpture.

(Object),,,"Panel showing the Assault of Māara. The haloed Bodhisattva sits touching the bodhimaṇḍa with his right hand from under the over-robe while his left holds high a loop of drapery and a gathered length from the robe below it which falls and spreads onto the seat; the drapery folds on his broad and full chest are shown as wide alternating grooves and ridges. His face is oval and full with the features harmoniously set into it. The branches above have clear pipal leaves and the face of the strewn seat has four panels, diagonally bisected to form triangles each containing an indented triangle, above a simple plinth, while the sides are plain.
On his left presumably Māra, wearing armour as on BM 1899.0609.19,34,68, a paridhāna, a crested turban, earrings and bracelets, prepares to draw his sword from a rectangular scabbard which hangs by a short, straight baldrick from his left shoulder. He is restrained or supported by a youthful figure with short hair beneath a chignon, who wears a collar and a necklace from his right shoulder over his left upper arm and a paridhāna and stands with one ankle across the other; he places one hand on Māra's shoulder and another over the baldrick. Beside them is another figure, with armour like Māra's but no paridhāna, holding a battle-axe below the head, its shaft resting on the ground; his left arm is damaged, and he has a segmented border of hair like ribbed beads. Above them, beside the tree, a horse's head and neck are turned towards the Bodhisattva; around the neck is a broad collar with bell-shaped pendant and the mouth spews flames. Alongside is a human monster with a double face, the upper face with hair, ears, eyes and nose while the moustached lower face has all the features from its hairline to the chin. He appears to have something twisted and in relief passing across his chest and perhaps connected with a damaged area beside him: it may be similar to the unexplained weapon held by a figure beside the tree opposite.
On the other side stands what seems to be the vanquished Māra, dressed as on the right but as if stealing away, both hands, with bracelets, over a sheathed sword, the baldrick coming from the waist and the suspension bridge visible. The scabbard appears to pass under the rolled bottom of the skirt and to be held between the knees. Māra is here apparently supported by the same figure as opposite but the paridhāna is shorter and the necklace runs over the opposite arm, while beside him stands an almost-naked bravo with a loincloth, and muscular legs, carved hourglass-fashion in contrast to the more columnar legs of the corresponding warrior on the opposite side. He has short hair and somewhat brutish features, and holds one damaged hand to the jutting chin while with the other he leans on a club resting on the ground. Above them is a partly animal-headed figure with rounded and protruding eyes and a long thin shaft across its chest beside the tree where the shaft seems to curve and join the foliage. Beside him a half-length horse-headed figure brings one paw or hand to its mouth while the other holds a sword. The slab is framed with a plain fillet above and one projecting over another below.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Peshawar District,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 6.40 centimetres; Height: 28.50 centimetres; Width: 49.80 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
Before the Enlightenment and under the bodhi tree the Bodhisattva was tempted by Māra with the pleasures of men, sovereignty and immortality as a god; when they had been rejected, Māra, disregarding the counsel of his son, returned 'in his great armour' with his army of 'frightful and monstrous beasts' who are described in great detail; creatures with such deformities may often be found on the sculpture. The Bodhisattva, after stroking his head and his bent knee, struck the ground thrice, the earth reverberated and Māra's army broke up, its animals stampeded, and the soldiers ran away and fell down in various ways. In the Pāli tradition the Jātaka Introduction also describes the discomfiture of a large army after Māra had mobilised different forces of nature in vain and the Earth had testified to the Bodhisattva's merit.
The above presentation of this theme was interpreted by Foucher, 1905-51: 1, 404-6, as showing Māra as assailant on the Bodhisattva's left and withdrawing discomfited on his right. For a simpler form see BM 1880.227. This presentation may also show Māra supported or, on the Bodhisattva's left, perhaps restrained by a figure that may be one of Māra's virtuous sons mentioned in texts as on this piece; Lahore 1281; Peshawar 128, 2070. The grotesque demons of Māra's army may be disposed as here and on Chandigarh 543 and Washington 49.9, and Māra's defeated soldiers may lie prostrate before the Bodhisattva's throne while Lahore 538, like Peshawar 2042, no doubt belonged to a more complex composition, with the latter showing Māra's three daughters and Māra himself seated at the side. Notwithstanding the textual presence of the earth goddess at this stage and what seems to be the earth-touching (bhūmisparśa) hand gesture invoking her as on this and the following piece, her appearance seems commoner on reliefs showing the events of BM 1895.1018.2. For an example of the present scene with the goddess see Berlin MIK I 10198, and for a fragment where the gesture above her appears to be the dhyānamudrā see Lahore 777 (Ingholt, 1957: 148, fig. 346).

Māra; Cummings, 1982: 162-71 with references to monuments.For a generally similar presentation see especially Leiden 2240-5 (Tissot, 1985a: fig. 133).
In Mahāvastu II. 314-43, 405-12 certain sons of Māra are well affected towards the Bodhisattva. An even more detailed description of the horrors of Māra's army is in the Lalitavistara XXI, which also tells of those of his sons in it who were favourable to the Bodhisattva being on Māra's right while those hostile were on the left, how his assailants' weapons became flowers, how Māra tempted the Bodhisattva after the assault and the earth-goddess Sthavarā appeared in order to bear witness to the Bodhisattva's merits after he had struck the ground. In the Samghabhedavastu I.115 the earth-goddess makes her homage, the daughters of Māra appear and the army's assault follows their failure. The monsters of Māra's army are also briefly described in Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra (Lamotte, 1944-80: III, 1582) and more fully again in Buddhacarita XIII. In the Lalitavistara the temptation by Māra's daughters follows immediately and another, shorter account, in verse, of Māra's army occurs at the end of the chapter. A subsequent temptation by Māra's daughters is reported in Saṃyuttanikāya I.124 (Feer, 1932: 124-7, translated Rhys Davids, 1917: 156-9) and Lalitavistara XXIV.l.378-9 (translated Foucaux, 1884: 315), and see Lamotte, 1944-80: 11, 880 (fn. 1).
On Peshawar 2042 Mara appears to attack on the Bodhisattva's right and is attended by a different person on each side. On Berlin MIK I 10198 (Berlin, 1984: 70-1, no. 34) assailants appear on both sides and Indra in cylindrical cap and a figure in a lion's skin headdress seem to belong to the demonic army.

The Buddha, taller than the flanking figures, stands in the centre of the panel in a posture of marked flexion, the abhaya hand bent back and the pendent left hand securing the robe. The drapery folds are marked by broad shallow grooves, some containing pairs of narrower grooves, and the raised neckline comes almost to a point; both shoulders are covered and two undergarments are visible. The wavy hair continues into the large uṣṇīṣa. At the Buddha's feet a kneeling serpent deity with hands joined wears a turban with a high crest and an uttarīya in the wide mode; his prominent five-headed serpent rather far above him is joined to the side of his turban by a neck in very low relief. Beside him and facing the Buddha a larger pair of serpent deities stands side by side in a crescentic curve, their visible arms curved above their heads. The male, with five-headed serpent just above, wears a turban with a high crest, a long earring, a collar and necklace, a paridhāna with rounded ends over his left leg and an uttarīya in the narrow mode; the female has a wreath, perhaps of cloth with a beaded motif and a flower as headdress, on wavy hair, an earring, collar and necklace, anklets, a diaphanous sleeved blouse leaving a bare midriff, a paridhāna and a scarf looping from the arms across the lower body. In her raised arm she may hold flowers, as perhaps in her joined hands does the smaller female figure, who is similarly dressed.
Above and behind the serpent deities arc the conventional rounded projections of mountainous terrain. In the top corner a half-length male figure holds a spear, opposite him beside the Buddha a small bare-backed Vajrapāṇi appears striding with outstretched and raised arms, holding a vajra, while the bust of another, small figure emerges below and is turned towards the Buddha.
Beside the Buddha stands another, taller Vajrapāṇi, also seen from the back, with his long overgarment looped across the legs, perhaps adapting the Western mode seen in BM 1922.0211.1, 1892.0801.10 and 1880.37, a small chignon on top of his head and the vajra emerging behind his left shoulder; he looks away from the Buddha at a monk whose right arm across the chest is wrapped in the robe. A figure with a crested turban, a paridhāna with pointed ends and a scarf billowing up from his left arm stands beside the monk with hands joined. Four half-length figures above, some turbaned and all wearing an uttarīya, raise their hands with flowers or join them in homage.
Above the scene is a register of caitya arches resting on vedikā railings and containing a bust of a figure with one hand raised (holding flowers). Between the arches are walls of openwork and inverted triangles with a barely recognisable bird seated on the coping.

The cutting of all the figures and details is stiff and sometimes sharp, with grooves and ridges to define drapery folds; the heads are round and full, the eyes rounded and protruding. This is one of a small group of pieces showing a varying number of monks, all with their right shoulders bare, of whom one sometimes carries a spouted pot and one regularly presents a circular seat. For examples see Swat V.422, an incomplete scene with three monks, one with hands joined, another carrying the seat draped as far as a distinct arcaded motif below; Chatpat 44, on which five monks approach the Buddha, one with the draped seat showing only convex mouldings at the bottom. The same presentation recurs in the iconography of BM 1914.0502.1. Examples are San Francisco (B6o SI); a piece in private hands where monks approach a disc with petalled rays and hold a seat barely showing at the bottom an undulating motif below the low drapery; yet another example of such an offering places the Buddha beside three wheels on a column and touching or turning a large wheel behind it (Kurita, 1988-90: I, fig. 272). On this piece an arcaded motif seems visible on the seat but a similar piece, Columbia 80.202 (Nagar, 1981: 10-11), although heavily abraded, seems to show the type of the almost totally draped seat. Dani tentatively suggests that Chatpat 44 shows the offering of a seat before the First Sermon, although a rectangular seat is offered in the few cases where a connection with the First Sermon in the usual iconography is certain or probable. The rectangular seat recurs on fragments where the connection can only be presumed but may also be found with a variant of BM 1970.0602.1. It is striking that round seats associated with iconographies discussed in BM 1914.0502.1 and BM 1970.0602.1 can be almost wholly draped as well as showing a construction suggesting that of the cane seat of Bodhisattvas and other persons.
The attribution of this piece to the cycle of the First Sermon can be only tentative, given that it stands on its own, that the numbers and attributes of the monks in the different examples vary and that the iconography of the scenes associated with BM 1914.0502.1 and BM 1970.0602.1 may still be thought uncertain. A further context for the presentation of a seat has yet to be established.
The presentation of a seat occurs when, after determining where and to whom to preach the First Sermon, the Buddha went on a begging round at Benares and then directed his steps to the Deer Garden at Sarnath where the five bhadravargīya ascetics, once his companions in mortification of the flesh, saw him coming. Since he had abandoned their joint quest for salvation, they first wished to deny him all honour and welcome, but as he approached their resistance left them and one took his bowl and over-robe, another offered him a seat, yet another a footstool and another water for his feet.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and with soil incrustation.

On the far left a small figure with long hair and on top a short horizontal length, looped and secured across the middle with one end pointing up, wearing a girdled paridhāna and uttarīya, turns towards the central figure and holds an opening lotus by its stalk in his right hand. He appears to be a young brāhmaṇa ascetic. In front of him a long-haired old brāhmaṇa ascetic, bearded, with a similar loop of hair on top and an uttarīya, joins his hands in the direction of the Buddha. Behind the monk in front is another brāhmaṇa ascetic with long hair, carved almost on the scale of the Buddha; and beyond the Buddha, again behind a monk, the very large head and torso of a young brāhmaṇa ascetic with long hair and the same style of hair on top as the other brāhmaṇas. Beside the Buddha are three monks in all, two with hands joined and right shoulder bare and one holding a lotus bud by its stalk in one hand, the robe in another and having both shoulders covered. Two appear to have one of the three monastic garments folded over the left shoulder, as in Eastern Indian, Sri Lankan and South-east Asian representations, and marked with rectangles representing the patches of cloth from which monastic garments were prescriptively made, features exceedingly rare in Gandhāra sculpture. In the centre the haloed and dominating Buddha stands almost in three-quarter view with moustache and densely linear hair with the uṣṇīṣa a large bun-chignon bound with a plain band. He raises the open right hand at right angles to the chest and secures the robe with the left hand. Both shoulders are covered and the drapery folds, as on the robes of the three monks, are defined by dense grooves, sometimes overlapping or crossing in a disorganised manner. Beyond the monks and at the far right, corresponding to the lotus-holding ascetic in the opposite corner, stands a woman with tunic, a paridhāna with girdle round it and a scarf running in the narrow mode from the left shoulder. Her hair forms a tall loop, and she wears earrings, anklets and a collar and holds a large opening lotus by its stalk in her left hand. What appears to be a prostrate figure before the Buddha can scarcely be made out except as a broken curved outline of the back, a slightly more defined head and one distinguishable elbow.
Apart from the fact that the Buddha's face has open eyes with a narrow ring of lids and incised pupils, the heads of the other figures are very similar, long to oval, with mechanical modelling, even where the monks' leanness is conveyed in sharp noses and chins and chisel marks, and the eyes are large, rounded and protruding, only rarely showing lids. The effect, perhaps partly due to wear, is of a staring remoteness, also seen in the Buddha.
The young ascetic on the left is, like the prostrate figure below the Buddha, perhaps Megha. They would thus form a scene in continuous narration and, while the position and appearance of the young woman on the far right readily suggest a donor, she may be Prakṛti and the whole composition could then be an early representation of the Dīpaṃkara story, despite the appearance of ascetics, unexplained in this context, unless they are connected with the presence of a fellow student of the Bodhisattva.
The border encloses between fillets an undulating stalk with regular nodes from which stalks branch carrying open lotuses and one bud and one leaf seen from the side. The open lotuses have centrally grooved petals and stamens; at the apex is a small open lotus.",,,,,,,Kushan,1stC-2ndC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: North West Frontier Province,schist,,,carved,Height: 49.20 centimetres; Weight: 34 kilograms; Width: 68.30 centimetres; Depth: 8.50 centimetres,,"Blurton, 1997:
The Dīpaṁkara Jātaka  was a popular story in ancient Gandhāra and is shown here in continuous narrative, that is, with two stages of the story in one relief panel. This was a standard convention in early Indian art, and used throughout the subcontinent as well as the lotus flower meander, which is a motif of long-standing popularity in the arts of ancient India.

By tradition the future Gautama Buddha, as a young Brahmin in a previous birth, took his Bodhisattva vow to become a Buddha before an earlier Buddha called Dīpaṃkara.

(Object),,,"Panel showing the First Sermon. The seated and haloed Buddha, wearing an over-robe over both shoulders and with a curved neckline in relief, touches the seat with his right hand and secures the robe above his lap in his left hand, from which the gathered drapery spreads in the usual way. The folds are defined by grooves. The Buddha's head is oval with sharp-cut features and narrow eyes below wavy hair in vertical curled bands under a high uṣṇīṣa. Behind it are a large plain halo and above, following its curve, a canopy of branches and distinct pīpal leaves. The strewn rectangular seat has a moulded plinth and a cross-hatched face behind a radiate wheel set on a vertically grooved pedestal flanked by couchant horned deer, their backs to the wheel but looking round at it. Beside the Buddha four monks with robes over both shoulders sit on similar rectangular seats aligned obliquely to his. Their heads, where undamaged, are thrown back and all have both hands covered in their robe and in their lap except for one monk who raises his right arm, wrapped in his robe, and joins his first two fingers vertically while the thumb and remaining fingers cross the palm. This distinguishing feature may be compared with the extended hand of a monk on the Buddha's right on Calcutta 5054, in whom Foucher (1905-51: I, 433) would like to see Ājñātakauṇḍinya, the first arhat; see also Faccenna-Taddei, 1962-4: I, 20 ad pl. LIVa. One monk, now almost headless, between two on the Buddha's right and with no visible seat, makes up the traditional five. Their robes lie in straight or semi-circular edges between the knees, and the faces of their seats have hatched or triangular patterns. Above the monks and beside the tree, celestials with long hair, a chignon, an uttarīya, a collar, earrings and bracelets join their hands or raise them to throw bunches of flowers. One, between two monks on the right, balances the monk opposite.
All the heads are oval, with emphasised chins and lower lips and rounded protruding eyes, and the tonsured monks have a hairline. Compare in general, and in such details as the angle of the first monk's head on the Buddha's left, Peshawar 1716.4
Framing the panel at the top is a register between fillets of acanthus leaves with drooping central lobes and flanking points joining those of adjacent leaves. Defining the bottom are mouldings with sawtooth enrichment, except where cramp mortises were perhaps subsequently made at the expense of the ornament.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Height: 27 centimetres; Weight: 8.60 kilograms; Width: 32 centimetres; Depth: 7 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The Buddha set rolling the Wheel of the Doctrine with his First Sermon to the five ascetics, always shown as monks, in the Deer Park outside Benares. They and numerous deities were converted and rejoicing gods reported that he had set rolling the thrice-revolved and twelvefold wheel of the Dharma.
In Gandhāra the wheel of this scene is found in a variety of positions against or beside the Buddha's seat, very often distinctly to the left to be beneath the Buddha's right hand; the deer beside it symbolise the location. No tree is mentioned in the texts but, although on the sculptures there is always one behind the Buddha, it varies and, like the deer, must, if more vaguely, refer to the setting. The auditors are usually five or fewer monks, often seated at an oblique angle; and various figures, of deities and of Vajrapāṇi, are used to balance the composition of a central Buddha and an uneven number of monks.
This is almost certainly the panel discussed in Barger and Wright, 1941: 20, as having pīpal leaves, celestials and the earth-touching gesture referable to the Enlightenment, while the monks and the wheel-and-deer belong to the First Sermon: the iconography is therefore deemed composite as on V & A I.M- 70 to C-1939 (Ackermann, 1975: pl. LXXXIa) with the same anachronistic combination of monks and pipal leaves.; Zwalf 1985
After the Enlightenment at Bodh Gayā, Gautama, now a Buddha, went to the Deer Garden at Sārnāth, near Benares, and preached his First Sermon, expressed as 'setting in motion the Wheel of the Doctrine', to the five ascetics who had shared his quest and privations. Before his seat is a symbolic wheel flanked by deer; around him sit the ascetics as monks, one making a gesture of benediction or acceptance, and gods beside a tree rejoice.","Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Cocheteux & Takahashi 1995 / Sérinde, Terre de Bouddha.

The haloed Bodhisattva is seated on the bed, his hair in a chignon tied at its base and one leg pendent; he raises his right hand while his groom approaches carrying a turban. He wears a paridhāna and the uttarīya leaves the chest almost bare, except for a necklace with one pendant and a collar with pendants of various shapes. His wife is asleep on the bed with one hand under her head on the pillow, the arm grasped by the other hand; she is bare to the waist and wears multiple bracelets, a necklace, long earrings, a wreath of floral pattern and, under her lower garment, anklets.
At the right a female guard with spear, eyes closed in sleep, wears a long-sleeved tunic, a necklace and a semi-circular ornament above her forehead. Below, head buried in her arms which she supports on a banded barrel drum, a sleeping attendant with anklets, a long-sleeved tunic with a beaded strip down the side and over it a girdle with ornamental plates securing her paridhāna, part of which is drawn up between her legs into the girdle at the back, sits on a low circular cushion; she wears a densely segmented wreath headdress and a large loop of hair at the back of the head. Another attendant squats frontally, wreathed head supported on her arms and resting between her elbows on her knees. Her legs, spread wide under her garment, have large anklets. Another attendant, dressed like the first with a segmented wreath headdress but a very long braid and anklets, sits with her back to the viewer and supports herself on a large and flat cushion. The groom Chandaka, with a moustache, leans forward behind the couch and deferentially presents a crested turban with bands and the piriform frontal ornament, himself wearing a crested turban, uttarīya, paridhāna, necklace, earring and armlet in three lobes.
The couch consists of a mattress, pillows with a raised band on the side and a patterned textile with bands of open flowers, scrolling, crossed and hatched zones hanging between the hidden legs. A slender pillar behind supports an oil-lamp and across the back hangs a curtain.
The prominent double-framed flanking columns have a Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts, while the base mouldings, unusually, are of Attic type with a scotia. A plain fillet frames the bottom of the panel.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Takht-i-Bahi,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 6.50 centimetres; Height: 26 centimetres; Width: 46.70 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
Although this piece was conceived in a larger and less populated frame and carved with far less precision and delicacy than BM 1900.0414.12, the treatment of the sharply outlined, open eyes of the male figures, the closed eyes of the women, the shape of the heads and the flat execution of the faces are very similar.
The Bodhisattva's revulsion in the women's quarters before the Renunciation occurs in the more developed sources which describe the repellent dishevelled postures of the sleeping women musicians, the Bodhisattva's sense of a burial or cremation ground and his summoning Chandaka and Kaṇṭhaka. A similar tradition is in the Jātaka Introduction where 'the mother of Rāhula' and the child are in the next room.
The scenes of the Great Renunciation among the Women usually show the haloed Bodhisattva seated on a couch and turned to his right while a woman, presumably his wife, lies sleeping on it, head to the right, as women musicians sprawl below with their instruments. Chandaka enters from the left with the turban as here or with both horse and turban. The Bodhisattva is usually with his hair in a chignon, but on Peshawar 1718 he is standing and wears a turban in front of Chandaka and Kaṇṭhaka.

The Bodhisattva, with both feet pendent, wears a necklace of multiple strands and confronted monster heads at the end of cylindrical terminals with a bead in between. His wife, with her right hand lying free, wears what looks like a narrow band from the left shoulder to the upper right arm and her wreath headdress has a pointed-leaf pattern. On the right a female guard with spear wears a long-sleeved tunic and necklace and stands beside a male figure with necklace and paridhāna. Both now lack faces. Below sits sleeping an attendant with diadem, earrings, necklace, anklets and sleeved tunic over a paridhāna. Another, on a low circular cushion, bare to the waist and with the same ornaments and a broad loop of hair at the back of the head, leans forward over a banded barrel drum. A third, dressed like the first attendant but with a different hairstyle and earrings, rests her head on a vertical banded barrel drum and passes an arm over the legs of another figure seated on a low circular cushion, naked to the waist and seen from the back, wearing a wreath and braided hair; a flower decorates her double anklet.

The drapery folds are shown by paired grooves. The head is oval, the damaged face slightly smiling and the wavy hair continues into the uṣṇīṣa above a raised hairline. Beside and above the halo are dense leafy branches and the strewn rectangular seat has a moulded plinth and a scrolled face.
To the Buddha's right a woman offers a long cylindrical and tapering object like a flask, with a groove round it at the top and bottom, not greatly resembling the garland suspended by a cord seen in BM 1892.0801.7. She wears a large headdress like a segmented wreath, a paridhāna round her sleeved tunic covering her left leg in two straight edges, a narrow scarf, an earring, bracelets and anklets; the woman behind her is similarly dressed but for the paridhāna and joins her hands.

When Mahāprajāpati and other women asked the Buddha to admit them to the Order, then entirely male, he refused; in yellow robes and tonsured, they appealed unsuccessfully again, Ānanda interceded and the Buddha, though relenting, imposed more stringent conditions of discipline upon nuns than those binding monks.
Since Foucher's provisional recognition of this subject on the present panel, without explanation of the vessel, more examples which might be grouped with it have been noted, but a conclusive identification remains desirable. Foucher himself observed that the women had already adopted monastic dress when Ānanda interceded for them and supposed that their lay appearance on the panels might be deliberate to ensure recognition of the subject and to avoid the confusion caused by the similar appearance of monks and nuns.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/dc50b/s3),,"1.Grey schist, with light surface damage and soil incrustation.

An uttarīya appears wound round his left shoulder. Beside him, but higher and smaller, a turbaned and moustached figure, presumably a claimant, with necklace, earrings and uttarīya stands with both arms down his side. Vestiges, apparently chiselled away, of other figures, also presumably claimants, are ranged behind the table with another, much like the first claimant, in three-quarter view beyond it.

The distribution of the relics falls into a shorter cycle within the Death cycle and presupposes them to have been claimed with threats of hostilities by eight parties who agreed to submit themselves to the arbitration of a brāhmaṇa. He is usually behind a table, which can be small or large, standing in the middle or to one side, the latter usually when the table is small and few claimants are shown, but he can be central with a small table and few claimants or central with a large table and a row of claimants flanking him. The claimants sometimes hold reliquaries, while on the table may be relics made into balls (according to Foucher their size is one droṇa) or caskets, as above. They can number the full eight or fewer; the balls are often cross-hatched or suggest grape bunches or blackberries. In this form they may represent the clay balls into which Hindu remains are still embedded for the asthikṣepa ceremony, but an enveloping mesh or floral garland seems also possible. The presence of guards is common to other scenes of the Distribution and may reflect the threat of hostilities over the relics.; Zwalf 1985

Under a trapezoidal roof with sawtooth cornice supported on columns with the usual Corinthian capitals and base mouldings, Sundarī, Sundarananda's (or Nanda's) wife or bride seated and wearing a tunic and a paridhāna round it, a scarf over her arm(s), a long chain necklace with pendant, anklets, bracelets, an earring and long undulating hair, looks at herself in a mirror, one damaged hand raised. She is flanked by three women similarly dressed and adorned, their hairstyles varying slightly with the style of the diadem and the height of the chignon. One of them raises a hand with the index and middle fingers joined, another is dressing Sundarī's hair, while a third looks on, almost as if from above. All three have expressively smiling and eager faces, their eyes wide open; a fourth, similarly dressed, stands in a side chamber with one hand raised, her eyes narrow and looking down. The mirror is on a turned stand beside a covered unguent box on a table resting on a Corinthian capital, its lost pedestal supported on a stand of curved legs. Hanging from floral stems, a wreath encloses a bag. In the side chamber beside the door, Sundarananda, haloed and with a chignon, collar, earrings and bracelet, wearing an uttarīya and a paridhāna, carries a bowl and looks back over his shoulder. He reappears in continuous narration just beyond a doorway, kneeling, still holding the bowl and with head raised towards the tall and haloed Buddha who looks down at him. He wears the usual three garments, ridged and terraced for drapery folds, his damaged right hand in abhaya, his dense wavy hair continued into the uṣṇīṣa. Like the women, the Buddha and Sundarananda have open eyes and animated expressions.
The palace superstructure is supported on columns, and, flanking the trapezoidal roof, above worn lion-headed corbels, the balconies have openwork faces, a sawtooth enrichment under the coping and heads of watching women like those below. A scroll runs along the door frame over which are capped battlements with triangular loopholes. A male wearing a turban with a crest at the side leans over them and raises a hand over the Buddha (to throw flowers).
Framing the scene are pilasters with a double-outlined, recessed oblong panel with curved top and bottom on the faces which, like the Corinthian capitals with their distinct upper and lower parts and corresponding base mouldings, are carried over onto the sides.

The Buddha is on his begging round at Kapilavastu and his half-brother Sundarananda (or Nanda), made to carry the Buddha's bowl and urged to return soon by Sundarī, follows him reluctantly, is prevented from returning and, though unwilling, accepts to be ordained. His true conversion occurs later after the Buddha, by his magic power, has made him see the superiority over Sundarī of the apsarases of Indra's heaven and he is then shamed by an elder of the community out of trying to possess them by the power derived from the practice of austerities.

(Object),,,"Top scene of three on an upright showing the Buddha standing and flanked by Brahmā and Indra. The haloed Buddha stands frontally in slight flexion, his right knee forward, the broken right hand originally in abhaya, the left pendent and covered in the over-robe. The neckline is tight and the drapery folds are mainly ridged. His head is oval and full. To the Buddha's left and turned towards him stands Indra, a haloed figure with crested turban, collar, uttarīya, paridhāna, hands joined and right knee flexed. To the Buddha's right Brahmā, a taller haloed figure with an uttarīya in the narrow mode, curled hair surmounted by a chignon, joins his hands. Above the latter a half-length figure with an uttarīya and a coiled chignon on one side or the back of the head raises an arm (to throw flowers); a corresponding figure with curled hair opposite also raises an arm. The faces are fleshy and full with narrow eyes.
The second scene down shows an encounter with a drummer. The haloed Buddha stands flexed in almost three-quarter view to the entire height of the scene, his damaged right hand in abhaya, his left hand securing the robe at his side, both shoulders covered and the robe edge in relief from the raised wrist to the left hand. Two undergarments are visible. The raised neckline is tight and the backthrow distinct. The Buddha's head is long and oval, and the inner features are asymmetrical; the uṣṇīṣa is bound at its base. The damaged drummer appears to wear a loincloth with the trace of a strap from his left shoulder for the banded barrel drum, which hangs obliquely so that his right hand strikes the top and his left hand the bottom. The figure stands in a flexed posture and has muscular legs contracted under the knees. Above him a figure raises an arm to throw flowers. Beside the Buddha a monk wearing a similar tight-necked robe secures it in his left hand and above him is another figure with one arm raised and a bowl-crop hairstyle.
The bottom scene of the upright shows the story of the dog.Unlike the other figures, the Buddha stands the full height of the scene but lowers his haloed head to address the animal. His over-robe covers both shoulders with a high neckline; his abhaya hand appears directed at the dog, while his left hand secures the robe a little above waist level and the edges in between stand out in some relief. The quite dense drapery folds are in a series of terraces. The Buddha's head is oval and the face full-fleshed with narrow eyes, the hair runs in almost straight lines into the uṣṇīṣa which has a fillet round its base. Squatting in front and looking up at him is a hairy and tailed animal, the undercut and nearer foreleg straight, the farther flexed. Behind it stands a monk with his right shoulder bare, the tonsured head thrown back, the features sharp. A half-length figure above with curly hair and round head bends forward, raising an arm to throw flowers. Beside the Buddha Vajrapāṇi, softly modelled, with clear features and with muscular legs narrowed at the knees, wears a lion's skin over the top and back of his head and secured across his chest by the forelegs, and a loincloth, perhaps the knotted hind legs of the skin. The flat vajra is held to his left shoulder by its narrowed middle and bottom. Another celestial above Vajrapāṇi has sharp features, narrow slanting eyes and a severe bowl-crop hairstyle. The expressive angle of the Buddha's body and the halo, almost detached from the back, enhance the sinuous character of the carving. The scene is flanked on one side by a half-pilaster with a summary Corinthian capital and the usual base mouldings under a sawtooth cornice. Along the right edge is a scrolled stalk with full-blown five-petalled rosettes.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 7.10 centimetres; Height: 17.20 centimetres bottom scene ; Height: 16.80 centimetres second scene down ; Height: 14.30 centimetres top scene ; Height: 55.20 centimetres; Width: 16.60 centimetres bottom scene ; Width: 16.50 centimetres second scene down ; Width: 16.60 centimetres top scene ; Width: 21.10 centimetres,,"The top scene could be a depiction of the Descent from the Trāyastriṃśa heaven (see BM 1917.1009.12) in an abbreviated representation. For another instance of a standing Buddha with Indra and Brahmā but without a stair interpreted as the Descent see Hargreaves in Marshall, 1951: II, 715, no. 110(a), and in, pl. 219, no. 110, where Indra's standing on the Buddha's right is acknowledged as being at variance with his usual position on the panels and the textual evidence that describes Indra's stair as on the Buddha's left.
Perhaps the second scene down of the upright shows the same subject as the left-hand scene on BM 1880.103.
The Buddha, entering the house of Śuka Mānava, son of Taudeya, saw his dog, Śaṅkhakuñjara, on a couch eating. When he saw the Buddha, Śaṅkhakuñjara barked, provoking from the Buddha a reproachful allusion to a previous encounter which so angered the dog that he sprang off the couch into an open drain below it. Thus Śuka found him on returning home and, angered by what he was told of the Buddha's words, sought him out and asked about the dog's previous existence. The Buddha explained that Śuka's father had been reborn as that dog and, to prove it, bade Śuka order the dog onto the couch to eat and, when he had obeyed, to show Śuka the treasure he had not revealed at the time of his death. Śaṅkhakuñjara leapt off the couch and, in another old room or building, he scratched and sniffed between the four legs of a couch, thus revealing four iron pots of gold. Śuka now returned to the Buddha in a favourable state of mind and the Buddha explained to his hearers that Śuka's rebirth, if he now died, would be as happy as it would have been grievous if he had died discontented towards him on account of his reproach to the dog. The iconography of this theme seems to fall into three groups: (a) as here where the animal is on the ground; (b) where the dog sits or stands on a seat or couch as in Peshawar 794 (Ingholt, 1957: fig. 120), 35L (Kurita, 1988-90: I, fig. 364), Lahore 1139 (ibid.: I, fig. 365); and (c) where two dogs, one on and another beneath a couch, must indicate continuous narration, as in the following piece where there is further discussion.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, slightly broken, worn and with some soil incrustation.

(Object),,,"Part of a panel showing the hand of the Bodhisattva laying grass on the seat of Enlightenment (bodhimaṇḍa) beneath the bodhi tree. On the right the hand of the lost standing Bodhisattva lays a long bundle of grass on the plain flat top of the bodhimaṇḍa. Behind it a figure rises almost in profile wearing uttarīya and with hair drawn back into a chignon secured with a fillet and a leaning tree trunk has branches with clearly pointed pipal leaves. Also beside the tree and standing frontally behind the seat another, slightly curving figure with similar hairstyle, collar, bracelets and uttarīya in the narrow mode raises his right hand as if in abhaya and with his left holds by the bottom of its scabbard a sword, the baldrick passing through the vertical suspension bridge and wound round the middle.
Left of the bodhimaṇḍa stand a male and female: the male is turbaned with a high crest to one side and wears a collar and necklace, earrings, armlets and bracelets, the uttarīya perhaps knotted and falling from the middle and in front of the paridhāna; the female stands with her left ankle over the right, wearing a wreath headdress with a loop of hair above, a beaded earring, necklace, a tunic and a long overgarment draped from her left arm, bracelets and anklets. Her stance emphasises the right hip on which she rests her hand while she leans with the other arm on the right shoulder of the male figure, throwing her head back; the drape over her right arm also emphasises the projecting hip and her necklace rounds one of her breasts. The male seems slightly to turn his head towards her as though distracted from his concern with the central event of the scene, and his mannered stance is emphasised by one hand on his necklace and the other on his hip. Above them are three haloed half-length figures turned towards the tree, all wearing uttarīya and chignon. Two have hands joined before them.
The rectangular bodhimaṇḍa, with its prominent top, has sawtooth enrichment, panels with blown flowers, and a high moulded plinth; the sides, apart from mouldings top and bottom, are smoothly worked and plain. The form of seat, ornamented or plain and with the kuśa grass of meditation frequently strewn on it, seems the Buddha's most usual seat on the reliefs; flanking monks so seated are presumably arhats.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Buner;  Found/Acquired: Swat Valley,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 7.40 centimetres; Height: 27 centimetres; Width: 26 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The accidental disposition of the break creates a dramatic contrast between the simplicity of the hand laying down the grass and the opulent softness, despite abrasion, in the modelling of the languorous-looking couple beside the bodhimaṇḍa; the broad, rounded planes of the male torso and the full, curved volumes of his face are of a piece with the woman's stance. Regardless of their identity, this contrast, highlighting renunciation, was perhaps not wholly accidental.
After receiving the homage of Kālika and Suvarṇaprabhāsā and considering the need to provide a grass seat for his Enlightenment as previous Buddhas had done, the Bodhisattva saw a grass-cutter called Svastika and asked him for grass; having spread the handful Svastika had given him at the foot of the bodhi tree, the Bodhisattva sat down upon it. In the Pāli tradition of the Jātaka Introduction the grass-cutter, called Sotthiya, gave eight bundles of grass and the Bodhisattva, after considering the cardinal points and facing the east, scattered the grass and a seat at once arose.
Foucher,  1905-51: I, 395ff, sees in the worshipping and emerging figure of Lahore 384 (ibid.: 1, fig. 199) a tree-spirit and refers us to four male or eight female spirits (devatās) of the bodhi tree in the Lalitavistara; the four almost identical male figures, three haloed, on this panel may be such a set; the figure with sword may then be an attendant on Māra (if not Māra himself according to Majumdar), who, with one of his daughters, already stands beside the maṇḍa preparing for the Temptation [see Foucher, 1905-51: II, I95-7 withdrawing his suggestion (ibid.: I, 396) that the couple is the nāga Kālika with consort]. For Māra beside the bodhi tree on the middle architrave on the North Gateway of Sāncī I see Marshall and Foucher, 1940: II, pl. XXIX. 
For a close parallel for the two figures beside the bodhimaṇḍa compare the bottom scene of a false gable slab where the tall Bodhisattva is accompanied by Vajrapāṇi only and a celestial throwing flowers; Majumdar considers the worshipper rising from the strewn seat of this relief to be the grass-cutter Svastika and the figure holding the sword in the same way as here, Māra. The bodhimaṇḍa has the same floral ornament and the grass is laid down on a top already strewn. For variants of this scene but all with the Bodhisattva laying down grass see Calcutta G. 18/A23272 (Majumdar, 1937; 45, no. 46 and pl. VIIIb) which shows worshippers as well as the couple beside the maṇḍa and a figure with girt sword on the right beside the Bodhisattva; Lahore 384 which has Vajrapāṇi, a worshipper rising from the seat and the couple; the fragmentary Chandigarh 87 (Foucher, 1905-51: 1, fig. 200) on which only a worshipper rises from the seat and the couple is lacking; Berlin MIK 1 204 which has Vajrapāṇi, a worshipping male and a woman who may hold a mirror. What appear to be variants without the laying-down of the grass include Peshawar 1884 (Kurita, 1988-90: 1, fig. 220) where a powerfully built and portly figure rises from the seat or behind it, holding a wand, while a small figure in the foliage, evidently the tree-spirit, kneels and joins his hands and the tall Bodhisattva may be in abhaya; and an unnumbered piece exhibited beside it (Sehrai, 1978: fig. 29) where an indistinct figure kneels at a corner of the seat; in both cases a couple much as here flanks it and the trees are both clearly pipal. Bombay 11, with a seated Bodhisattva in abhaya and a distinct maka-radhvaja, is an unusual iconography and, assuming the same subject, in contrast to Bombay 10 where there seems to be a hand laying down grass (Chandra, 1974: 11-12, pis 25-6). On Calcutta G. 18/A23272, Peshawar 787 and Chandigarh 87 the earth-goddess (Foucher, 1905-51: 1, 398-9) emerges as a half-length figure out of acanthus on the face of the bodhimaṇḍa.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, chipped and worn.

(Object); The Invitation of the Śākyas. (Object); The Intervention of Ānanda. (Object),,,"The top scene perhaps shows the Invitation of the Śākyas. The haloed Buddha, shown on a larger scale than the other figures, is seated in abhaya, both shoulders covered, the neckline prominent and tight, the over-robe with folds defined by grooves, some paired, and the edge from the right forearm curving in relief down to the gathered drapery on the seat from under the left hand. The head and neck are long and the wavy hair continues into the large uṣṇīṣa. Beside the halo leafy branches hang downwards. The Buddha's high and strewn seat is otherwise plain. On his right is a kneeling monk, damaged hands formerly joined and right shoulder bare, between two watching half-length figures with garments apparently over both shoulders; on the Buddha's left a monk, seated with one leg at an angle suggesting a kneeling rather than a crossed-leg position, wears the robe oyer both shoulders, with the hands in dhyāna and covered. Between him and the Buddha, to judge from the tonsure, is another monk. The heads are long and oval, the features sometimes sharp and the eyes rounded and protruding.
Second scene down of four on an upright, with the Dīpaṃkara jātaka in two incidents. The Buddha Dīpaṃkara stands with an outstretched hand in abhaya to the full height of the scene, his left hand securing the robe at waist level. Both shoulders are covered, the neckline is high and in low relief and the usual undergarments are visible. The hair is in wavy strands and with a seemingly coiled uṣṇīṣa. Megha appears twice. As a standing figure, holding flowers in his hands, he has long hair and a chignon, drapery wound round his left shoulder and upper arm, and a lower garment with a girdle; his chest and arms are muscular. He is then shown almost on all fours before Dīpaṃkara with his right forearm lying on the framing fillet below. Behind Megha stands a woman with a garment over her left shoulder and a girt paridhāna round it, a collar and anklets, a high chignon, and holding a flower in her raised right hand. Above her and beneath the bracket arm from the pilaster a rectangular projection with two faces in double outline may represent a lintel rather than a balcony. Beside Dīpaṃkara and looking away from him stands Vajrapāṇi with short hair, a short lower garment, powerful arms and torso with horizontal bands of musculature; one hand is on his hip, the other holds the bottom of a long vertical vajra between thumb and finger(s). Another, monastic figure faces him. Below the top of the panel are three complete tops of spectators with chignon and tunic and the vestige probably of another. All the heads are long and oval, the features sharp and the eyes rounded. At one side a sharply cut pilaster, the shaft with a recessed oblong panel with curved top and bottom, has a Corinthian capital under a capital with sawtooth enrichment and one voluted bracket arm and, below, the usual and summarily moulded base. The pilaster continues on the return but the bracket capital extends to the edge of the Corinthian capital only. Above the panel and also continued on the return runs a cavetto with acanthus leaves, each with a drooping lobe in the middle and lobes at the sides with points meeting those of the next leaf.
The third scene down of the upright shows perhaps the Intervention of Ānanda. The haloed Buddha sits with his over-robe covering both shoulders and forming a high neckline; an edge in relief falls from the arm of his abhaya hand and joins the gathered drapery from his left above the lap. His neck and head are long and the high uṣṇīṣa of wavy hair is secured by a fillet. The strewn seat is plain and high, and leafy branches hang down beside the halo. On the Buddha's left a woman in almost frontal position with a small chignon and fillet, a garment passing over her left shoulder, a paridhāna round it, and a scarf over her left arm looped into the girdle and anklets, holds a cylinder bound horizontally at the top, middle and bottom, perhaps a garland of flowers suspended by a cord rather than a cylindrical vessel as offering to the Buddha. Between them appears to be a figure with wreath headdress and beyond both a damaged male lay figure in uttarīya and with joined hands. Above them are half-length figures, one with a chignon and another in a turban. On the Buddha's right are two monks, both with their right shoulder uncovered and one in discourse with the Buddha, his right hand before his chest, his pendent left under the robe, the other with hands joined. Three half-length figures, two with crested turbans, look on above and beside them.
The fourth scene down of the upright shows the Buddha before a doorway. The haloed Buddha, almost the height of the frame, one hand in abhaya, the other, which is damaged, to his side, his over-robe covering both shoulders and with a tight neckline, stands slightly turned to his left, his hair like stray locks under a tight uṣṇīṣa. Above him a celestial holds a wreath, the edge marked with petals. Beside the Buddha a figure, in crested turban and uttarīya in the wide mode and a gathered robe end swinging away, stands elegantly in front of a doorway pointing to it. In between them the head, with chignon, of a robed celestial looks on. The oblique doorway is lower within its moulded architraves than the figure in front of it and its door of two panelled leaves appears partly open. Above the doorway triangular loopholes and a balcony projecting on brackets must belong to the same building. Beside the Buddha, Vajrapāṇi, partly turned away, wears his uttarīya in the wide mode and holds his vajra at a slant at the left shoulder; his hair is short. Beside him a monk has his right arm wound in the robe but apparently no hand emerges. Above them are two half-length celestials, one looking outward, robed over both shoulders, the other seen in three-quarter view from behind, with long hair, a chignon and an uttarīya; he extends a damaged arm, evidently to hold, with the figure opposite, the Buddha's wreath.

Common to traditions of the Buddha's first visit to Kapilavastu is the intervention of Udāyī; according to one, when the Buddha was at the Bamboo Grove at Rājagṛha soon after the Enlightenment, his father Śuddhodana sent Kālodāyī or Udāyī the Black together with the groom Chandaka to invite him and 'with bent knees and bowed head Kālodāyī implored the infinite One'. They became monks and, at a suitable season for travelling, persuaded the Buddha to return to Kapilavastu. In the Pāli and Mūlasarvāstivadin traditions repeated failed embassies were followed by the success of Udāyī alone who invited the Buddha to Kapilavastu, himself becoming a monk, in the latter tradition after Buddha's assent to Śuddhodana's letter. 
For what may have been a similar garland, but held as on BM 1899.0609.21, see a woman on the Buddha's left on a damaged panel of an upright (Delhi 68.183, formerly Lahore 4(W)), where, however, the figures opposite are lay, one with hands joined.

All  the finds were shipped to London for sorting, research and publication, and  subsequent distribution. The distribution of the finds between London and  India was determined by specialists, appointed by the Government of India  (through the India Office, London) and the British Museum, who drew up  lists of the objects for approval by both sides. The specialists included:  Raphael Petrucci, under supervision of Dr E Denison Ross (nominated by  India Office) and Laurence Binyon (British Museum) on paintings;  Dr F W  Thomas, Dr E Denison Ross (both nominated by India Office) and Dr L D  Barnett (British Museum) on manuscripts and written documents; Dr E  Denison Ross (nominated by India Office) and Laurence Binyon (British  Museum) on archaeological/other finds.

On the lower wall of the body is a partly damaged band of three grooves which fail to join up exactly; between it and a single such groove just below the rim is a line of Kharoṣṭhī characters. On the lid, from the rim upwards, is a band of three grooves, a band resembling a bead-and-reel ornament in low relief, the beads pierced or grooved horizontally, and above them a broad cross-hatched band. The shoulder of the lid carries a broad plain fillet and two thin convex mouldings and on the top is a slightly convex band with a line of Kharoṣṭhī; a broad fillet rings the foot of a small hollow bowl surmounting the lid to form a second smaller compartment. This has an inner flange at the rim to accommodate another lid as on 1880.98, which was already missing when the relic deposit was first uncovered. The lid and body of the casket are flanged to fit as on 1880.99. The body must originally have been compartmented as in 1880.98, for traces survive on the inner wall of four rough projections aligned as if to meet in the middle. They were evidently removed prior to interment to make room for the gold casket 1900,0209.1 found inside it.

The casket tapers slightly towards the rim and lacks a lid. The arcading round the side consists of eight pointed caitya-arches resting on pilasters. Each arch has a plain recessed face and the pilaster capitals consist of a plain fillet above a torus and a fillet. The pilaster shafts have each a recessed oblong panel with an outlined border curved at the top and the base mouldings repeat those of the capitals in a contrary sequence. The compartments form two groups (A and B) of three at opposite sides to each other, each group having an almost identical central Buddha flanked by closely similar, worshipping deities in profile, and the three are separated at both ends by a single similar compartment containing the same frontal worshipping figure.
The Buddha stands frontally in slight 'dehanchement', but his left leg is flexed and its foot raised, while his right leg points sideways as if he is walking. His right hand is raised, palm outwards, to the centre of his breast in a less usual, perhaps archaic abhayamudra, while the left hand rests somewhat indistinguishably at the hip, not very clearly holding the robe which seems also to be wrapped round the wrist and falling from it; a length of the robe also appears to hang from the right arm. The neckline on Buddha A is coherently in relief, while on Buddha B it is more diffused and linear; Buddha A is generally more finely executed, a thinner and taller figure with a long oval face and a more pronounced peak of the undulating hair where the face of the other is rounder, more youthful and with a less clear moustache. On both the robe hangs with some effect of wet drapery. Both Buddhas are haloed, but on Buddha A the halo has a raised border and the uṣṇīṣa is much larger and, with the open eyes and moustache, recalls an early Buddha type in stone.
On each Buddha's left stands a haloed turbaned figure of Indra in profile, his head somewhat inclined, the left leg flexed a little backwards, the left arm, with a bracelet and armlet, raised and hand(s) joined. He wears a paridhāna, and unusually the uttarīya hangs front and back over his right shoulder and loops round the left waist; on figure A a short length also hangs over the left shoulder. Other differences are in the position and relief of the lower left leg and in the more abundant drapery of the uttarīya on figure B.
On each Buddha's right a haloed and bearded figure of Brahmā, with a large chignon and a water pot held in his left hand, walks towards the Buddha and raises his right hand no higher than the Buddha's; it is seen from the back with the fingers curved forwards. He wears a paridhāna, and the uttarīya over his left shoulder, with a long fluttering fall at his back, appears on the left arm and loops in the narrow mode round the right of the body. Differences between the two are the finer tooling and relief of the taller and erect figure of group A, while that of B seems more squat and has a more bowed posture; both make a distinctly classicising impression.
The haloed dividing figure is youthful and stands frontally, his flexed left leg and his right foot recalling the Buddha's stance; his hands are brought together before his breast and he wears a paridhāna and uttarīya with two long ends falling on each side; the uttarīya crosses the body in the narrow mode from the left shoulder where it also forms a horizontal semiloop. Both arms wear an armlet and bracelets. The hair is in a chignon drawn in at its base; below it falls from a parting to form pronounced 'bouffant' locks at the sides, especially on the figure behind the Indra of group B, whose expression is much more of a beatific smile. Like that of Buddha A, his halo shows a raised border. Figure A, standing behind Indra A, also appears taller and in greater and clearer relief and his expression seems more austere. Huntington holds these figures to be a Bodhisattva (1985, p.115), while Cribb has discussed them as perhaps Maitreya (1985, pp.82-3).~Above and below the arcade is a row of garnets in gypsy settings separated by a motif of four petals or lobes, some more like pairs of linked heart shapes. In the spandrels are distinct and well-articulated eagles soaring with outspread wings and heads turned to each other to form pairs, their feathers carefully indicated by shallow grooves and punched dots. At the bottom of the casket are mouldings as of a pillar base with a plinth and a rather small torus under a large cavetto. On the underside is a blown lotus of eight double-outlined and centrally grooved petals narrowing towards the gynoecium, which is punched with large dots; between the petals and the border is a field densely punched with smaller dots, and between the points of the petals are small, standing, opening lotuses in the fashion seen on 1899,0609.39 (Zwalf 1996).",,,,,,,Buddhist,1stC (circa),Made in: Darunta,Excavated/Findspot: Bimaran Stupa 2,gold; garnet; pitch,,,repoussé; inlaid,Diameter: 6.60 centimetres at base ; Diameter: 6 centimetres at rim ; Height: 6.50 centimetres,,"This reliquary was found inside the inscribed steatite reliquary 1880.27.

Errington: Masson's manuscript record shows that the reliquary was found without a lid at the time of excavation (Uncat. MSS Bundle 1b, f.1; MSS Eur. E161/VII, f.68). He also records that the reliquary contained a 'small metallic plate, apparently belonging to a seal, engraved with a seated figure [1880.3851.b], 30 small circular ornaments of gold [1880.3691, 1880.3695, 1880.3696, 1880.3982], sundry beads of coral &c., pearls &c.' and beads of 'nilam [sapphire, specifically purple sapphire, i.e. amethyst], agate, crystal &c.' (1880.3699.g, 1880.3855.c, 1880.3884.g, 1880.3893), a heart-shaped turquoise inlay (1880.3893.k), and 10 small cross-shaped turquoise (?) inlays of the right size and shape to fit into the repoussé quatrefoils that alternate with the inlaid garnets around the rim and the base of the casket (1880.3851.c, 1880.3855.b). The relic deposit also contained four posthumously issued coins in the name of Azes which according to research done in 2012-13 are now dated c. late 1st century (IOC 201-IOC.204).; Zwalf 1985: This famous object was found in a 'stūpa' inside an inscribed stone box, now also in the British Museum. Framed by arcades formed with the Indian pointed arch are the Buddha and the gods Indra and Brahmā shown twice and separated by a worshipper whose head-dress, ear-rings and armlets suggest a Bodhisattva. Between the arches are eagles and, above and below, garnets.

In the Pali tradition of jātaka 485 the armed king of Benares comes upon a kiṃnara couple playing and dancing beside a stream; enamoured of the kiṃnarī, the king shoots the kiṃnara, who is the Bodhisattva, but his consort refuses the king and calls upon the gods. Indra, moved by her fidelity and disguised as a brāhmaṇa, sprinkles the Bodhisattva with water and restores him to life.
The identification of this theme in Gandhāra is due to Foucher following Vogel; a Sanskrit story of the faithful kiṃnarī lacks the playing and dancing and in it the widowed sprite shares her consort's funeral pyre. Whatever the subject, on the only other comparable piece reported the archer is on foot and aims at a couple also with a male harpist; the next scene shows the male musician lying dead while the archer in two successive incidents is perhaps trying to take a grieving woman away. The scene at Bhārhut captioned 'Kinara jātaka' lacks any sufficient feature in common with the Gandhāra pieces and Luiders, 1963: I36ff., refers it to another story.

The Bodhisattva, born as the ever-charitable Viśvaṃtara, gave away to brāhmaṇas the auspicious white elephant on which he rode and was on this account banished with his wife Madrī and their two children. On the road he gave away his chariot and horses and the parents continued on foot, each carrying a child, to a hermitage; there, in Madrī's absence, he gave away his children to be servants of a brāhmaṇa. When Madrī returned she was given to Indra, disguised as a brāhmaṇa, for the Bodhisattva's final test. The god then resumed his shape, restored Madrī and, by his intervention, the children were redeemed from the brāhmaṇa by their grandfather.

In the Mahāvastu account the Bodhisattva became incarnated as Śyāma(ka), to serve, as their only son, a frail and blind pair of ascetics. While fetching them water he fell victim to the arrow of a king hunting a deer and, as he died, entrusted his parents to the penitent king's care. Amid the lamentations of animal creation the king brought the old couple water and the tidings of their son's death and led them back to where he lay. As his mother cradled his head, his father invoked his son's merits and by that incantation restored him to life. For the role of Indra in this connection see 1880-55. The Pāli tradition has a somewhat different frame-story in which the king, when hunting, deliberately shot Sāma ( = Śyāma), because he realised that he was an exceptional being and wished to prevent his escape until he had learned who he was. The story ends in the same way but both parents caress their dead child, both invoke his merits and their sight is restored with his life. For secondary accounts see Foucher, 1905-51: I, 279-83; Foucher, 1955: 269-74; Ingholt, 1957: 49; Malalasekara, i960: 11, 1097-9, s.v. Sāma Jātaka; Schlingloff, 1985, with a survey of versions.

According to the summary List of sculptures from Yusufzai (Cunningham, infra) supplemented by an old photograph, this length, together with 1880.32 on the left, formed the sixth riser on the stair to the main stupa at Jamalgarhi.
It was Foucher who proposed to see in this length part of the Maitrakanyaka jātaka; the hull then represents the ship still intact on the voyage, and on the damaged part between it and the shore Maitrakanyaka struggles landwards on his plank after the shipwreck. The rest of the riser then shows his successive reception by two and four apsarases in front of their respective towns. The other representations of this jātaka show the end of the story: on one short length Maitrakanyaka is received before a door and makes music with a woman before meeting the victim of the wheel, but the other may belong to a series of fragments on which Maitrakanyaka rides a horse at the head of a caravan. The present length is incomplete; 1880.32, its admittedly damaged neighbour on riser 6 according to the photographic record, hardly suggests its continuation, but 1880.43 may have belonged although it cannot have been immediately adjacent. If this is the Mahājanaka jātaka, as was once supposed in the Museum, only the beginning of this length could illustrate the king's son's shipwreck and, doubtfully, his reaching Mithilā, and there is again no obvious connection with the rest of the length or its neighbour 1880.32 .
The Bodhisattva as Maitrakanyaka was a sea-faring merchant's only son who took up his late father's dangerous livelihood; as she clasped his feet to dissuade him, he kicked his mother's head. Shipwrecked on his first voyage, he reached land on a plank and was successively received and entertained in four cities: in the first by four, in the second by eight, in the third by sixteen and in the fourth by thirty-two apsarases. Having escaped their attentions, he reached a city of iron in which a man was undergoing torment as a flaming metal wheel revolved upon his head, the blood, marrow and chyle from it forming his only sustenance. As this was in punishment for disrespect to a mother, the wheel at once came to rest on the Bodhisattva's head and would have long so continued until another, similarly guilty, should come, but the Bodhisattva's readiness to save others by enduring the torment for ever earned him its instant cessation. In the Pāli tradition a merchant's son, Mittavindaka, was cast adrift on a raft to save the ship and met on successive islands female spirits of the dead in numbers increasing by the same geometrical progression before encountering a man with a sharp wheel on his head and taking it on his own. But Mittavindaka was not the Bodhisattva and he was obliged to expiate to the end.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, chipped and worn.

A number of examples combine the three elements of this piece, the Buddha, a disc on a pedestal and monks, which could stand for the Three Jewels of Buddhism, the Buddha, the Doctrine and the Order. In most instances the disc is, as here, floral or floral with the characteristics of a wheel, but a plain disc with a border of radiate petals is found on a piece now in private hands. Save for here, the Buddha always appears to touch or turn the disc. The combination of these three elements also occurs on a harmikā (San Francisco B60 SI) in succession to the Birth, the Great Departure and Entreaty to Preach and this suggests that the iconography may have served as a variant representation of the First Sermon, especially as one of apparently five monks is carrying a seat of the type discussed in BM 1940.0713.4, where other examples which suggest the same continuous narration are listed. In other instances, like the present, where the cloth may be an offering, no seat is brought. Deer in this connection, as against examples with the three wheels (compare BM 1970.0602.1), appear never to be present.
A disc, lacking any floral aspect and seen as a solar symbol of the Buddha (see BM 1966.1017.2), can occur with what seem to be the knees of the Buddha's crossed legs behind it, perhaps confirming an innovating iconography. In the present case the common overlap between the wheel shown as such and floral discs (compare Foucher, 1905-51: I, 429) may indicate that the Doctrine is indeed to be understood here and that the identity of the Buddha with the Doctrine (Benisti, 1977: 65-6) is further emphasised by the appearance, so far isolated in the present iconography, of his crossed legs behind it while the flanking Buddha in the exceptional abhaya gesture may be in an expository or legitimating role as he is perhaps also, but with a different gesture, on BM 1902.1002.26. Although the present piece differs from those discussed above, it is notwithstanding grouped here with others of the First Sermon cycle as a possible variant.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, exfoliated and with soil incrustation.

(Object),,,"One of four faces of this stupa base or harmikā block shows the Birth of the Bodhisattva. Māyā, with the left leg across the right at the ankles, wears a draped garment from the left shoulder, a paridhāna round it, a scarf which passes behind the back and hangs from both upper arms, a cross-hatched wreath headdress on top of the head, earrings, bracelets, a collar and anklets. The haloed infant in high relief, with uṣṇīṣa, and both arms undercut as they rest on the swaddling cloth, emerges almost to the legs from her right side. Māyā's attendant, who has been identified with Mahāprajāpatī, her sister, wears a sleeved tunic over a paridhāna, a twisted and rounded circular headdress, perhaps of cloth, and the same ornaments and stands slightly inclined, one leg crossing the other below the knees. Another female figure behind her, dressed like Māyā but with a segmented wreath or diadem, brings her right hand to her mouth in astonishment while the left hand holds a cross-hatched palm branch. Indra, opposite, bends forward with an unusually long swaddling cloth above his flexed left leg. His uttarīya is in the wide mode and he wears a collar, earrings and a cylindrical cap with a motif of squares with crossed diagonal lines. All the figures have long oval faces and sharply cut features with rounded protruding eyes. Above them are branches, spreading in the centre and at each side, the leaves symmetrically paired.
The panel is flanked by somewhat broad framing pilasters with sharply cut Corinthian capitals in distinct upper and lower parts, a recessed oblong panel with curved ends top and bottom on each shaft and the usual base mouldings. The centre line is continued vertically in the middle of the framing border below.
In the clockwise direction of worship this face is followed by those described in  1880.227, 1880.227 and 1880.227.
Other one of four faces of a stupa base or harmikā block shows the Assault of Māra.The haloed Bodhisattva sits as on BM 1895.1018.2, except that the over-robe clears his right thigh; the neckline is in somewhat sharp relief, and the grooves defining drapery folds curve across the broad chest. The oval head has sharply cut features and beyond the sharp hairline wavy hair continues into the uṣṇīṣa. The branches above bear clear pipal leaves. The strewn seat has a moulded plinth, plain sides and, on the face, the same motif as on BM 1895.1018.2. On the Bodhisattva's left Māra is about to draw his sword from the scabbard; he wears a paridhāna and a twisted scarf or uttarīya over his left shoulder, a turban with a knot or crest over his left ear, a collar, earrings, armlets and bracelets. Above him is a half-length figure with tousled hair, a grim expression, a sleeved and quilted shirt and perhaps a shield over his left shoulder. On the right is presumably Māra again, the turban knot, since it here appears over the other ear, perhaps intended for the back, and he appears to be stealing away, his hands held before him; his sheathed sword, now between the knees, hangs by a baldrick running from behind the back and though a suspension bridge on the scabbard. Above, another half-length armed figure wears a helmet with a curved brim rising to a point above the forehead.
The third face of a stupa base or harmikā block shows the Entreaty to Preach the Doctrine. The haloed Buddha, hands in dhyāna and covered in the over-robe, wears this garment over both shoulders; the curved neckline is in relief and the grooves for drapery folds are regular and curved except where the robe is over the hands and forearms, and spreads below the hands as if tucked in between the knees. The Buddha's oval face has sharp features almost in a smile and the wavy hair continues into the uṣṇīṣa. His body is broad and the legs and knees crudely large. Above him are one short and two long branches with evenly paired leaves, the long branches with looped garlands; his strewn rectangular seat is unusually low with a simple plinth and a leaf pattern on its face. On the Buddha's left Indra, with hands joined, uttarīya in the narrow mode, wears a now damaged turban, earrings, a collar and bracelets; on the right Brahmā with hands joined, uttarīya across the chest and partly in higher relief, has long hair under a chignon and a horizontal length of hair looped at one end.
The fourth face of the stupa base or harmikā block shows the First Sermon of the Buddha. The haloed Buddha is in abhaya, the left hand rests in the lap and the gathered drapery of the robe spreads onto the seat, while the edges falling on both sides of the right wrist are in prominent relief. A pair of branches with evenly paired leaves, and one branch broken in the middle, form a canopy and on each outer branch hangs a looped floral garland. The Buddha's rectangular strewn seat has a moulded plinth and on its face a triangular motif with indented triangles (stylised opening lotuses alternately inverted). The wheel has twelve spokes. Flanking him obliquely on each side sits a monk with hands in dhyāna covered in the robe, which lies spread with a straight edge between the legs below. The tonsured head of each one is round, sharply cut and with a hairline. Unlike the Buddha's, their seats have a motif of slanting leaves on the face. Behind each monk stands a now headless figure with hands joined: one has a bare right shoulder, the other a variant mode with the right shoulder and upper arm partly covered.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Height: 23.50 centimetres; Width: 34.90 centimetres max. ; Width: 34.30 centimetres min. ,,"Zwalf 1996:
The Bodhisattva was born in the Lumbinī Grove as Māyā held a branch of the śāla or plakṣa which the Bodhisattva's glory had caused to bend towards her in salute. His time in the womb fulfilled, he emerged from Māyā's right side, mindful, conscious and undefiled, causing her no pain, and Indra and Brahmā Sahapati received the child, wrapping his every limb with a silken cloth. In the Saṃghabhedavastu Māyā stood beside a flowering aśoka tree as her time came, Indra protected her modesty by scattering the crowd around her with wind and rain, transformed himself into an old nurse and then received the child on a cloth of antelope skin. In the Pāli tradition, too, the child was born as the mother held a branch of a tree, the śāla, which had bent down towards her, and attendants drew a curtain and retired; the child was successively received on different cloths by the four Mahābrahmās, the four mahārājas and by men.
Scenes of the Birth agree in showing Māyā in the centre, right hand raised and grasping a branch (a complete tree seems never to be shown), legs often crossed at the ankles, the infant emerging half-length and sometimes haloed as here from her right side, while on Māyā's left a female supporter stands in a variety of postures, usually holding Māyā whose left arm rests on one or both of her shoulders. Indra, turbaned and sometimes haloed or, as here, with his cylindrical cap, bends forward with a cloth; behind him is often Brahmā with or without one or more figures worshipping, rejoicing or showing surprise. Behind Māyā's assistant a female often stands holding a palm branch or an Indian equivalent of peacock feathers and sometimes she or a second female holds a spouted pot. At the top of the scene, flanking the branches of the tree, are musical instruments.
In the scene of the assault of Māra, two figures of Māra are assumed here according to Foucher's interpretation given in BM 1895.1018.2. In the clockwise direction of worship this face follows that described in BM 1880.227.

The art of Khotan, once a flourishing Buddhist centre, is known from only a few fragments. There must have been numerous shrines with painted walls. This Buddha seated in a niche has the characteristic stance and proportions of similar small figures, all looking in the same direction and varying only in the colour of the robes, which covered whole walls as 'Thousand Buddha' images. The robes show schematised drapery patterns, originally much freer, derived from the art of Gandhara: note the grouping of fold lines in threes, and the sharp angle made by the upper edge of the garment of the neck.","Waugh & Sims-Williams, 2010 / The Old Curiosity Shop in Khotan",Not on display,,,buddha,Representation of: Buddha,,,,Donated by: Sir Clarmont P Skrine,,,,1925,,,Asia,,"1925,0619.20",,,,,1925061920
