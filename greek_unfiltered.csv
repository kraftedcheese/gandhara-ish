Petrie mentioned two broken bronze figures of Nefertum from the cache found in a building located in the southern part of the city (on this cache and its content: Petrie 1886, 41- 42; Masson 2015). Naukratis provided also several amulets in glazed composition and stone representing Nefertum in addition to these amulets (Masson 2015, 77, fig. 3.8).

He is definitely linked with the other dwarf god Bes, with whom he appears often on the same amulet or in the same context (on the relationship between these two gods: Bulté 1998, 379 and 382). As an amulet, Pataikos seems to appear as early as the 6th dynasty, although amulets of the dwarf god are better identified from the New Kingdom onwards (Andrews 1994, 39). His amulets are very common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods (as illustrated in Mendes: Wilson 1982, 32, pl. XXIX n°3-4) and as popular as Bes in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming).

The bust rests on a curved plainfaced plinth, which has two wick-holes with wick-rests below, to enable its owner to use the object as a lamp, probably in a household shrine. The back is plain, except for a triangular filling-hole cut through it, and a pierced suspension-lug applied behind the diadem.

XIX and Roux 1980, esp. 258-60 (with earlier references). The style of this capital originates in Achaemenid art which later became popular in the Greek world, such as on Delos. Roux 1980 provides a detailed analysis of the antecedants and parallels, where he stresses the likely votive, rather than architectural, function of the object. Previously, Karageorghis and Vermeule suggested that it may have formed part of a monument celebrating a naval victory (1966), while Yon connected it with the later Roman cult of Zeus Salaminios whose origins she traces to a much earlier phase of the city (2009, 305 and fig. 10). 
The date of the capital remains uncertain, with views ranging from the mid-4th to mid-3rd century BC to Roman imperial times (see Karageorghis and Vermeule 1966, 24; Vermeule 1976, 46 and pl. II.2; Yon 2009, 305 favours the first half of the 3rd century BC). 
See Smith in Murray and Smith 1891, 342-3 for early comments on the object.

Such coffin-fitting developed from Archaic types,  of which one imported example was found at Naukratis (Fitzwilliam  Museum, Cambridge GR.57.1887), there were many, very similar,  variants of this Gorgon found at Naukratis (Greco-Roman Museum,  19873,19872, 19871 in Schreiber 1908, 40, fig. 26a and Breccia  1930, pl. 46.6; Egyptian Museum, Cairo JE27201.1-6 JE27201.5 in  Edgar 1905, pl.

These are usually  depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888, 0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes  (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting  from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of  plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare  (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of  Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM  1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and  Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as  are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum  of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671). Several Naukratis  pieces are in private collections (Parlasca 2001, pl. 26; Sotheby’s  New York Sale Catalogues, 18 June 1991, no. 84; ibid., 31 May 1997,  no. 99; Christie’s Sale Catalogue, 8 December 1993, no. 128). 
		The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis  production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found  there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804,  boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites,  suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other  production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to  the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905,  61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt  1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the  beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One  parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie  Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels  for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of  Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE  89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195;  el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various  coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis  (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888, 0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from  another wooden coffin).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671). Several Naukratis pieces are in private collections (Parlasca 2001, pl. 26; Sotheby’s New York Sale Catalogues, 18 June 1991, no. 84; ibid., 31 May 1997, no. 99; Christie’s Sale Catalogue, 8 December 1993, no. 128). 
The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites, suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905, 61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt 1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671). Several Naukratis pieces are in private collections (Parlasca 2001, pl. 26; Sotheby’s New York Sale Catalogues, 18 June 1991, no. 84; ibid., 31 May 1997, no. 99; Christie’s Sale Catalogue, 8 December 1993, no. 128). 
The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites, suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905, 61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt 1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671).

The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites, suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905, 61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt 1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

Such coffin-fitting developed from Archaic types, of which one imported example was found at Naukratis (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge GR.57.1887), there were many, very similar, variants of this Gorgon found at Naukratis (Greco-Roman Museum, 19873,19872, 19871 in Schreiber 1908, 40, fig. 26a and Breccia 1930, pl. 46.6; Egyptian Museum, Cairo JE27201.1-6 JE27201.5 in Edgar 1905, pl.

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671). Several Naukratis pieces are in private collections (Parlasca 2001, pl. 26; Sotheby’s New York Sale Catalogues, 18 June 1991, no. 84; ibid., 31 May 1997, no. 99; Christie’s Sale Catalogue, 8 December 1993, no. 128). 
The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites, suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905, 61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt 1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671). Several Naukratis pieces are in private collections (Parlasca 2001, pl. 26; Sotheby’s New York Sale Catalogues, 18 June 1991, no. 84; ibid., 31 May 1997, no. 99; Christie’s Sale Catalogue, 8 December 1993, no. 128). 
The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites, suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905, 61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt 1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695).

The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould).

D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695).

The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671).

The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites, suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905, 61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt 1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

At least three mould series of large rosette (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.1107; British Museum GR 1926,0624.9; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum  AN1888.227, same mould series as   GR1888,0601.141) and five series of small rosette (group 1: Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.793-796, same mould series as Bristol, City Art Gallery and Museum H2264.4 and H2264.5, British Museum GR 1888,0601.139 and GR 1888,0601.135; group 2: Boston, Museum of   Fine Arts 88.792, same mould series as Cambridge, Fitzwilliam   Museum GR.52.1887; other mould series in Boston, Museum of Fine  Arts 88.797 88.798 88.799 88.800; University College London Institute of Archaeology, UCL1934, Oxford, Ashmolean Museum   AN1888.228-331) were found at Naukratis. Pieces, probably from the same series and said to be from Naukratis include parallels sold on the art market (Sotheby’s New York Sale Catalogues, 18 June 1991, lot  84, and 31 May 1997, lot 99, 2 examples). All were coated with   white, painted yellow and normally have traces of gilding. Fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean  Museum, Oxford AN1896- 1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). However, gilded parallels, possibly from the same mould series, have been found in the cemetery of nearby Kom Firin (Farid 1973, 8 from Tomb G7, Cairo Museum JE 89424; Spencer 2008, 12; Leclant 1952, 247, fig. 30), suggest these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Also similar Hellenistic rosette coffin-fittings have been found in Cyrenaica (Besques 1992, Louvre D4453). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin   at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695).

D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671). Several Naukratis pieces are in private collections (Parlasca 2001, pl. 26; Sotheby’s New York Sale Catalogues, 18 June 1991, no. 84; ibid., 31 May 1997, no. 99; Christie’s Sale Catalogue, 8 December 1993, no. 128). 
The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites, suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905, 61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt 1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671). Several Naukratis pieces are in private collections (Parlasca 2001, pl. 26; Sotheby’s New York Sale Catalogues, 18 June 1991, no. 84; ibid., 31 May 1997, no. 99; Christie’s Sale Catalogue, 8 December 1993, no. 128). 
The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites, suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905, 61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt 1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695).

The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671).

The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould).

D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695).

The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671).

The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould).

These are usually depicted with snakes tied above and below the chin (GR 1888,0601.128), but sometimes omit (or remove before firing) the snakes (GR 1888,0601.129) and sometimes have added wings projecting from the forehead (GR 1888,0601.127). One example was made of plaster (GR1888,0601.695). Later Ptolemaic variants are rare (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.790, 88.784; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh A.1888.22 A; Castle Museum, Nottingham NCM 1888-62; University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia E135 in Hilton Price 1897, 6, no. 31), as are Roman (?) forms (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 88.789; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA671).

The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta silt fabric, and Naukratis production is most likely, as coffin-fitting moulds have been found there (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.4804, boukranion mould). Parallels have been found in other Egyptian sites, suggesting these had a wider distribution and possibly other production centres. Other parallels from Egypt have been dated to the 2nd and 1st  century BC (Schmidt 1994, no. 267; Watzinger 1905, 61, fig. 120), from Lower Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 277; Schmidt 1994, no. 268)  and smaller examples from Lower Egypt, dated to the beginning of  the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, no. D4575). One parallel is thought to be from Ptolemaic Memphis (London Petrie Museum, UC48468, though could also be from Naukratis). Parallels for the Naukratis examples have also been found at the nearby site of Kom Firin (Choucri 2003, 126, ‘2e type’; Farid 1973, Tomb G7, JE 89422, JE  89423, JE 89564; Basta 1979, shaft tomb T140, 194, 195; el-Fattah and Georges 2007, 30–1; Spencer 2008, 12). Various coffin-fitting types were used on each wooden coffin at Naukratis (Coffin-fittings GR 1888,0601.131-135 were from one coffin; GR1888,0601.136-9, GR1888,0601.141 and GR1926,0624.9 were from another wooden coffin).

Murray et al., Excavations in Cyprus, London 1900). 
Dr Peter Higgs, who made the identification, observed that the head is out of place in the group of marble heads from Ephesos registered in the same sequence in 1972. He also notes that this type would have been regarded as as 'Cnidian' in the later 19th century, though it is actually a Hellenistic portrait bust, probably of the 2nd century BC. See now, P. Higgs and T. Kiely 2010, CCEC 
The excavators claimed the head was part of a statue which stood on the base with a bigraphic inscription to Demeter and Kore (1896,2-1.215); if so, this raises important questions about the date of the inscription and the survival of the syllabic writing system of Cyprus into the Hellenistic period.",Kiely 2011a / Kourion; Higgs and Kiely 2009 / Four unpublished marble sculptures of Hellenistic date from Cyprus in the British Museum,Not on display,,,,,,,,"From: Turner Bequest Excavations, Curium",Funded by: Emma Tourner Turner (bequest),,,,,"Excavated in the Temple Site (Site C) at Kourion by thre British Museum Turner Bequest in 1895 but was not registered in the main sequence of material from this site (1896,2-1.1-400) nor included in the BM catalogues of Greek sculpture.

Parallels either have a suspension loop for use as a pendant (British Museum 1856,1223.1691), or a metal shaft inserted into the bottom to create a hair pin (Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna, 2011, 301). While Haevernick (1968, 648) dates the group strictly to the 4th century BC, excavated examples from Acanthus (Greece) (Trakosopoulou 2002, 80, fig. 4), Alexandria (Breccia 1912, 101, no. 318, fig. 64), and Hagoshrim (Israel) (Yeivin 1966) suggest that they are produced c.330–200 BC. Widely distributed across North Africa, Spain, Italy, Sardinia, the Levant and the Black Sea coast, these are commonly associated with Punic manufacture on the basis of a concentration in the Punic sphere. In consequence, the female figure has been identified as Tanit, whilst the bearded males have been identified as Baal-Hammon and Eshmun-Melquart (Carreras Rossell 2003, 23; Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011, 301) or Silenus (Trakosopoulou 2002, 81). However, the distinctive layered wig resembles the diagnostic Isis locks found on Isis-Hathor figures of the Ptolemaic period; the bearded male could then be taken to represent Serapis. Irrespective of production place, this example may have been interpreted by the wearer as one of a range of deities.

Although the worn state of the figure makes it difficult to be certain what she originally looked like, the non-idealised appearance of the face suggests the possibility that she is intended to represent a nurse rather than a divine kourotrophos figure of the type popular in Cyprus in earlier eras. The question of kourotrophos figures in Hellenistic Cyprus has been discussed by Queyrel, who concludes that unlike their predecessors they no longer directly represent the Great Goddess, although doubtless her memory lingers on in them. Figures of women actually feeding infants, like this one, are in any case more rare than those of women carrying children, like Terracotta 2891; only one example of a woman feeding a baby was found at Amathus. Although found in many parts of the Hellenistic world, the subject is perhaps most popular in Egypt, where it derives from images of the goddess Isis.",Terracotta / Catalogue of Terracottas in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The amphora stand has an infill of ballusters that Bailey suggests (ibid. 25) is more probable than a cobra-frieze as previously assumed (Walters 1903, C 576; Schürmann 1989, 271, no. 1030).

Comparanda. See a naked, but headless, Gaul in Dresden: Fischer 1994: no. 992, with a warlike stance, dated late second and third century ad. Not unlike ours is a terracotta from Hehia once in the Fouquet Collection, who stands in a rather similar but more static pose; he is not naked or cloaked, but wears trousers and his hair is rather longer (Perdrizet 1921: pl. xciii:377). A complete figure in the Ashmolean Museum shows a fully armed Gaul, with a luxuriant moustache and long hair, wearing mail and trousers, again with an oval shield, and a long-sword at his right side (Ritchie and Ritchie 1985: 9). A head in Leipzig, broken from a figure, has a hairstyle similar to that of ours (Laubscher 1987: pl. 21:3). For the use of the Gaulish/Celtic shield by Gauls and other mercenaries of the Ptolemaic armies see Sekunda 1995: passim; the shield boss of ours is not in Stary 1981. Representations of Gauls as mercenaries in the Seleucid armies come from Nineveh (British Museum me 55430 and me 1929.10-12.356): they bear Gaulish shields, but, reflecting Persian custom, are much more decorously dressed than is our Gaul, and wear draped Phrygian caps, tunics and, probably, trousers. For discussions of Gauls in Egypt and in Hellenistic art, see Reinach 1911: 33–74; Laubscher 1987: 131–54 and Hannestad 1993: 15–38.

This figurine is labelled in pencil with three characters, but only the third character (3) is readable. This object was registered with pieces labelled T, Φ,  or TAΦ, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite. All figurines sent out by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to various museums appear to have come from Petrie's excavation of the Aphrodite sanctuary, during Gardner’s season at Naukratis in 1885-1886. This figure is highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary and '3' probably represents the context number in which it was found.
A number of Cypriot terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the    Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various    other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, Φ,    or TAΦ, followed by a context number, designating these as coming    from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner’s    excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum    registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have    been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary.

An example from the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, (no. 1975.364) has a disc decorated with a star-like rosette between the horns.

He has a pug face and is largely naked, with drapery below his big belly, around his right hip and legs. He carries a tambour or circular dish (now broken) against his right side; from his right wrist hangs a large purse. Like his companion, he wore a fillet on his head, but this has largely broken away together with his forehead: he may have been bald; the tops of both of their heads have also flaked away.

The king is depicted with a band across the forehead which was likely intended to be topped by a royal headdress or crown. The wide set almond shaped eyes include a thin incised line illustrating the upper and lower eyelids, and the eyebrows are indicated by faint flat ridges along the forehead which converge with the bridge of the nose. The nose is long and slightly hooked and the ears are exaggerated in size. The roundness of the cheeks is conveyed via folds of flesh on either side of the mouth, and there is a notable dimple in the centre of his chin. His thin lips, with a clear cupid’s bow along the upper lip, are also visibly upturned at the outer corners of the mouth to form a subtle smile. The outer edges of the surface on the reverse have been completed behind the ears, and the top of the head has been worked to create a smooth flat surface. At the centre of the reverse a rough recessed strip of stone, now damaged, protrudes from the flat surface and was possibly intended to secure a separately made wig or headdress. The surface of the neck was also carved with a small tenon to be inserted into a separately made body. 

In addition to the damage along the reverse, there are small chips to the surface of the figure’s face, notably at the left side cheekbone and tip of the nose, and there is discolouration along the left side of the face. The limestone is extremely hard and finely polished.",,,,,,,Ptolemaic,3rdC BC,Made in: Egypt,Excavated/Findspot: Naukratis,limestone,,,polished,"Length: 5.60 centimetres max ; Width: 4.30 centimetres max ; Depth: 4.70 centimetres max ",,"The facial features of this figure shares similarities with known portraits of Ptolemy V; in particular, the eyes, hooked nose and subtle smile is typical of sculpture from the 30th Dynasty. This particular figure originated from Naukratis (Gardner 1888), though its exact context is unknown. 

Faces of kings in the round were a popular subject for sculptor's models, particularly in the 30th Dynasty and early Ptolemaic Period (on nature and functions of this type of model, see Tomoum 2005; see also Ashton 2014 for a different interpretation regarding king's heads and busts). Though many models would include a flat plane on the reverse with an incised proportional grid, here instead there are deliberate workings to attach the head to a body and possibly a wig; the cream colour of the limestone may have also contrasted with the wig, which could have been made from another material such as a different coloured stone. Similar pieces were also made from plaster and limestone (Tomoum 2005). Sculptor's models of different types were discovered in Naukratis, suggesting the possible presence of such workshop on the site. Such objects are also suggested to have been used as votive offerings and deposited in temples (Silverman 1997), though the full process of such a practice is uncertain.

The fabric is very pale and finely levigated and resembles clay from the central Greek mainland (Burn, Higgins 2001, pl. 2; see Tanagra clay no. 2051). The white coating is firmer and glossier than the soft fragile gypsum used on Egyptian Terracottas. D. Bailey suggests this is from the same workshop as Terracotta no. 3165 (Bailey 2008, 62, no. 3198 = no. C602) found at Benghazi. Scientific analysis (MSRD no. 37261, BMRL no. 7048-00002-T; Project ID PR07048) shows the white dressing to be kaolinite (BM Department of Scientific Research Report 7048, 10 May 1999; Bailey 2008, 67). Kaolins are not found near any terracotta production centres in Egypt (only the Red Sea coast, Sinai and Aswan).

There is no indication that the two pieces actually belong together at all. The neck muscles suggest this should face forward, not to the side as reconstructed. The head is also too big for 1905,0612.4. The marbles of both head and bodies are the same, probably Pentelic, but the head has been exposed to fire at some point in its history, and this has given it a rather reddish hue.  It is, of course, possible that the head was burnt after it had been broken from the body, but it could equally well have belonged to a similar cat.  The scale of the head does appear a little large for the body to which it is attached, particularly when it is compared with the two cats that preserved their heads.  The head may belong with GR1905.6-12.5 which is slightly larger than GR1905.6-12.4, but certainly of the same marble as the head. When the head first arrived in the museum, it was registered under a separate number, and the entry states that it is cut flat behind, with an iron rivet in the middle.  
Possibly represents a leopard or large wild-cat, a lion is unlikely. The sculptor was probably intending to create a life-size cat in stone, but knowing the physiology of lions better created a mini-lion, or leonine cat (see also 1905,0612.4, 1905,0612.5 and Athens).

This appears to be confirmed by two marble cat sculptures in the same style, and possibly the same sculptor, in a group of artefacts from Naukratis acquired for Cairo Egyptian Museum from the nearby town of Damanhur (Edgar 1903, CG27518-9). Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from  Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis,  or less likely Alexandria.

The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis,  or less likely Alexandria.

An object in the shape of a female head. The band around the head indicates that the subject is royal. The rounded facial features are typical of this particular queen's images. Ptolemaic statues usualy have a marble head fitted into a body of another material. This has also been interpreted as a representation of Aphrodite. Marble, chipped. Medium-grained white island marble (Parian ?). Broken away under the chin; all the back of the head missing. Repaired at the left cheek. Chipped at hair, brow, nose, lips and chin.

Probably the head is from a classicizing work of late Hellenistic times, possibly representing Aphrodite (Buddle & Nicholls 1967, no.79, pl. 26). The poor preservation makes it impossible to determine whether an earlier figure is being freely copied. A broadly comparable little head is in New York; see Richter (1954, 89 no. 163, pI. II6). Probably classicizing work of about late Hellenistic date. Probably classicizing work of late Hellenistic or early Imperial date. (Hogarth 1898-9, pI. 14. 8).

Good parallels from Athribis (Tell Atrib) are dated to the  3rd century BC (Szmańska 2005, no. 196 and 199). Classical to early Hellenistic Egyptian parallels (Fischer 1994, pl.10, no. 62), probably copying late 5th century BC examples from Attica (Higgins 1954, no. 697) and late 4th century BC parallels from Knidos (Burn & Higgins  2001, no. 2523).

This trench was done ""just N. of the ‘Great Wall’"" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary – 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming a). This amulet might come from such a context.
Several of these amulets were discovered in Naukratis, almost all being quite to very schematic. Therefore it is often difficult to identify properly the deity represented. His attitude, kneeling with his hands raised on both sides of his head, relates to the gods Shu or Heh (on both types of amulets: Andrews 1994, 19 and 88-89; Herrmann et al. 2010, 51-52, type 20). Since their iconography can be very close, Herrmann prefers to not decide between both deities (Herrmann 2006, 88-92, Pl. XX-XXII). Such amulets are very common on Late Period settlements (Masson forthcoming b).

The most visible parts of the sculpture have been carefully finished and retain the original polish except on the cat’s chest and around his right front leg where scars from the claw chisel survive. Those areas that would have been partially concealed have been left in a coarser state.  The front part of the neck has been gouged out but has been concealed by a modern plaster fill.  Below this the cat’s chest is roughly worked and rather flat. The raised, right front leg has only been roughly blocked out on its left side and the cat and the bird have not been properly separated.  The underside of the cat is also less carefully finished and was originally held up by a support.  This is evident from the oval shaped block measuring 5.5 x 3cm which, containing a dowel hole that remains about half way down the cat’s belly.   At the other end, the areas around the genitals and backside have been left rough, with a series of drill holes at the lower junction where the tail emerges.  Again though, this area would have been less visible when the tail was complete. 
Medium grained marble weathered to a warm golden colour, possibly Parian marble, from the island of Paros, Aegean. Traces of Egyptian blue paint on the chest of the bird.
The surface is generally in a good condition. One or two small areas have suffered minor damage.  A small chip has been repaired on the cat’s left cheek and there are notches missing from the right side of the face.   A larger crack runs from the left side of the cat’s chest and through the bird, but there are no signs that this is a repair.  The extremities of the sculpture have suffered more.  The left foreleg is missing and both of the hind legs from the thighs down. The tail remains only as a small stump.  The left ear is almost entirely missing and the eye sockets have been damaged by the act of attempting and succeeding in removing the inserted eyes. The bird has lost its lower body and its head has been broken off where it emerged from the cat’s mouth.  Restorations of the left foreleg, both hind legs and the entire base, including the pillar to support the bird.",,,,,,,Hellenistic,332BC - 200BC,Made in: Egypt (?),Excavated/Findspot: Naukratis (?),marble,,,carved; painted; drilled; polished (?),Height: 22.50 centimetres right foreleg of cat to tip of cat’s ear ; Height: 24.50 centimetres; Length: 51 centimetres from cat’s tail stump to bird’s body ; Length: 5.50 centimetres oval area of support ; Width: 3 centimetres oval area of support ; Width: 13 centimetres,,"Part of a group of 20 cat sculpture fragments in marble and limestone, many in the same style and possibly the same sculptor (GR 1905,0612.1 - 20). These include a base with a dedication to Bubastis. All were purchased by Flinders Petrie, from a dealer in Cairo who gave it a Bubastis provenance. Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin. This appears to be confirmed by two marble cat sculptures in the same style, and possibly the same sculptor, in a group of artefacts from Naukratis acquired for Cairo Egyptian Museum from the nearby town of Damanhur (Edgar 1903, CG27518-9). Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from  Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis,  or less likely Alexandria.
The bird is possibly a representation of a goose (?). All the birds represented in the British Museum Naukratis cat sculpture group were covered with traces of Egyptian blue plaint. Geese in the Late Period were commonly sacrificed for Horus, son of Isis, representing the symbolic destruction of the enemy (Junker 1910, 69-79; Wildung 1977; Graindorge 1996, 89-91; Bouanich 2005, 151), as represented in contemporary third century BC depictions of Harpokrates (Horus) strangling a fox-goose (British Museum GR 1845,0705.1; Ridgway 2006: 645 fig. 1; Schollmeyer 2003; 2007). Geese were also sacrificed during the festival of Isis in Alexandria and Philadelphia (Dunand 1973, 76;  P. Cair. Zen. IV.59560; BGU VII.1501) and for the empress Arsinoe Philadelphos (P. Oxy. 27 2465; Schorn 2001, who was likened to Aphrodite and Isis).

The most explicit statement accompanies an illustration of the present item where it is said to have been found in a tomb located between the village of Enkomi and the monastery of Ayios Barnabas, that is to say, in the Western necropolis of the city where he dug in 188-81 and 1883 (Ohnefalsch-Richter 1893, 480, pl. CCII, 7; 1881; 1883, 138-40). However, the written description of an unillustrated figurine from a tomb found in the Northern Necropolis of Salamis closely matches the present item (Ohnefalsch-Richter 1883, 135, no. 1). Moreover, in the admittedly extremely brief account of his excavations in the Western necropolis on pp. 138-40 of the same report - in the area corresponding to the findpot of the figurine given in the excavator's Kypros - there is no mention of a figurine of this type. He clearly describes however GR 1884,12-10. 246; Walters 1903, A426 as coming from this area. There is no doubt that the present item was excavated in Ohnefalsch-Richter's second phase of activity at Salamis because of the registration date, so there is little possibility that the figurine came from the 1880-81 season which revealed many more items of this date but none matching the description according to the published report (Ohnefalsch-Richter 1881, 244-51).

Richter identified the subject as an Oriental ruler, and Plantzos, an Egyptian priest: the latter identification is perhaps more applicable considering the Egyptian attributes. The distinctive facial features suggest that a portrait is intended, but the sitter remains anonymous.

This ring belongs to a series of similar bone finger rings found mostly on Cyprus and in Alexandria. They all show a portrait bust of a woman in relief. 
Many of these facial features have been compared to the coin portraits and heads on faience oinochoai showing Arsinoe II (reigned 278-270 BC). This and the other similar rings may represent this particular queen; the diadem certainly suggests that the woman is royal. The rings may have served a commemorative function, or were perhaps made during the festival of Arsinoe, the Arsinoeia which was inaugurated after her death and became one of the most celebrated festivals in Egypt. Though she ruled for such a short time, Arsinoe II fast became a most popular queen, and Cleopatra VII herself adopted many of Arsinoe's traits in her Egyptian royal iconography (cat. no. 160); even Augustus' empress, Livia, modelled her early portraits on Greek-style images of Arsinoe II.
The date of these rings, which all follow similar forms and details of representation, is disputed, but if they do show Arsinoe II, they could date to any time from her death in 270 BC until late in the Hellenistic period. The bone rings show great similarities to a series of bone gaming counters, most of which have been found either in Alexandria or in sites around the Bay of Naples (cat. nos 327-333). These counters, some of which show portraits of Ptolemaic rulers, private individuals and Roman emperors, are thought to date to the late Hellenistic or early Roman period. It has been proposed that the portraits on the rings and the associated counters were inspired by a sense of nostalgia that was prevalent in the first century BC to the first century AD, as the Ptolemaic empire fell increasingly under Roman political control.

The male head has a full head of hair, swept up over the brow and behind the ears. A slight depression in the hair probably indicates that a diadem was added, perhaps made of metal. The face is long, with a high furrowed brow and a fleshy bar above the eyes. The cheekbones are strongly marked and prominent, and the chin is broad and square. The long nose is slightly pointed and has an upturned tip. The short mouth has tightly closed lips. The rather pinched features, with the heavily lidded, mean eyes imbue the portrait with a marked sense of severity, but this may have been unintentional: the sculptor has not finished his work, and the facial features are only roughly worked.",,,,,,,Hellenistic,240 BC - 200 BC; 3rd century BC,Made in: Egypt (?),Excavated/Findspot: Temple of Apollo (Kalymnos),marble,,,,Height: 39 centimetres,,"Walker & Higgs 2001
The presence of a diadem suggests that a royal personage is intended. It was formerly thought to be a representation of Herakles (see Walker & Higgs 2001, 9), but Gisela Richter claimed that the small mouth and heavy chin resembled the coin portraits of Ptolemy IV. If this is the correct identification, it is difficult to determine the exact context of the portrait in this unusual herm form. It may have been a dedication in the sanctuary of Apollo on Kalymnos, an island under Ptolemaic control during the reign of Ptolemy IV.

As so often in Ptolemaic and Roman Period representations of Osiris, his shroud is coloured red. The weighing of the heart is carried out here by two gods, Anubis and Horus. Hor's heart is in the pan to the left; but in the right-hand pan, where we would expect to see the feather of Maat, is instead a tiny seated figure coloured black. The crossbar of the balance hangs from a feather-shaped peg attached to the upright support, on the top of which squats a small baboon. This creature is a form of the god Thoth, who acts in a different form and with a different duty elsewhere in this ""trial"".  To the left of the balance stands Thoth, here in human form with ibis head; he is the scribe of the gods, and he holds a scribe's palette and a reed brush, ready to note down the results of Hor's interrogation. In front of Thoth sits a monster ready to spring forward to consume Hor's heart if he fails to pass the test. This creature has the head of a hippopotamus, and the body of a lion. At the top of the scene the great gods of Egypt are shown, formally seated on thrones, waiting to deliver judgment. There are thrity-five in total. Each holds a feather of Maat. Maat herself is present too - not as a feather in the balance, and not as a woman with a feather on her head, but literally as a feather head.

The back of the sculpture has been destroyed, although the angle at which the stone has been cut suggests that it originally had a back pillar and was therefore Egyptian in style.
Comparisons with other examples of this type of image indicate that the queen once wore an Egyptian crown. The styling of the hair and portrait features suggest a date of around the time of Ptolemy VI and the head may, therefore, represent either Cleopatra I or II.

This portrait, in Parian marble, is of exceptional quality. It has been identified as Octavian, but the face lacks Octavian's broad cheekbones and jaw. The subject is more likely a contemporary senior official of considerable authority. The treatment of the eyes recalls some Hellenistic royal portraits, despite the Roman features.

The usual portraits of Augustus differ in one remarkable feature from the description of his personal appearance given by Suetonius in his 'Life', 79. We there read 'nasum et a summo eminentiorem et ab imo deductiorem', i.e. the bridge of his nose was higher up than in general among men. Apparently it had been the custom of artists to tone down this characteristic feature. But assuming, on other grounds, that this head represents Augustus, more advanced in life than in his usual portraits, we recognise in it exactly the shape of nose described by Suetonius. These other grounds are, the finely modelled cheeks, the compressed lips, as of one who had few teeth, and those bad (dentes raros et et exiguos et scabros), the dimple on the chin, the penetrating glance, with eyebrows knit and overhanging the eyes (acrius contuenti), the serene expression (vultu tranquillo serenoque), and ears of moderate size (mediocres aures). The unfinished state of the hair deprives us of the means of comparison in this respect, but Augustus is known to have been negligent with his hair (in capite com comendo incuriosus).",Sculpture / Catalogue of Greek Sculpture in the British Museum; Walker & Higgs 2001 / Cleopatra of Egypt: from History to Myth,On display (G72),"Exhibited:

The nose, chin and lips are damaged, the locks of hair are weathered, and the separately made upper section of the head is missing. There are patches of surface incrustation. The neck has been broken from the body at an angle.
This portrait represents a young man with a tightly curled hairstyle consisting of deeply drilled locks. The almond-shaped, deeply set eyes are placed beneath fleshy brow muscles, and give the impression that the subject is looking upwards slightly. The lips are damaged, but the lower one is short and fleshy. The head turns sharply on its neck to the right, giving a dramatic twist, typical of Hellenistic ruler portraits. The damage caused to the nose and mouth, presumably when the statue to which it belonged fell from its base, furnish the facial features with a pronounced pathos that may not have been so apparent when the head was complete.",,,,,,,Hellenistic,2ndC BC; late 2nd century BC - early 1st century BC,,Excavated/Findspot: Temple of Apollo (Cyrene),marble,,,drilled,Height: 23 centimetres,,"Walker & Higgs 2001
Even though the facial features seem less harsh than those of the so-called Ptolemy Apion from the same context (BM Sculpture 1383), the tightly curled locks of hair, and the extensive use of the drill to create them, are very similar on both portraits. Also closely comparable are the rounded shapes of the face. A diadem has not been carved on the surviving portion of this head, and ought not perhaps to be restored on the missing upper section, as then the subject would have worn the band very high on his head. Instead, the diadem may have actually been rendered in metal or perhaps even cloth and placed over a shallow depression behind the three tiers of curls.
The style suggests a date in the later second century BC, and the prime candidate for a royal subject from Cyrene at this time is Ptolemy Apion. Unlike the other Apion from Cyrene, which is carved as a rather stiff, formal and frontal portrait, this portrait is of the dynamic and heroic type, typified by nude Hellenistic ruler portraits. The two portraits may have stood side by side within the Hellenistic temple of Apollo, one showing the king in an almost uncompromising fashion, the other, this head, more as a heroic ruler, almost raised to the ranks of the gods.
Ptolemy Apion was the illegitimate son of Ptolemy VIII Physkon (reigned 170-164 BC; 145-116 BC). Apion's mother was reportedly his father's mistress Eirene, who had a Greek name but may have been a native North African. Apion was given Cyrenaica to rule, and when he died he bequeathed his kingdom to Rome.

Compare two Late Antique objects, thought to be kiln furniture for African Red Slip Ware, from El Mahrine in Tunisia, similar to the current piece, but with a depression on the convex face, rather than a pierced hole; they have  patterns incised on the concave face (Mackensen 1998, 438, fig. 5).  Not unlike, in the British Museum, is an African Red Slip Ware oval object, very neatly made, with a narrow piercing in the centre, said to be from Utica (GR 1979.8-14.2, unpublished). It is decorated with an incised winged phallus and an unread cursive Latin inscription referring to a workshop: the good-luck sign suggests it might be for  the protection of a kiln; it may be a peep-hole for examining the kiln during firing. Two fragments of rather similar, but apparently larger, inscribed objects from Naukratis, dated to the Ptolemaic period and regarded as possibly pot-stands or kiln furniture (Leonard 2001, pl. 3.21). They appear to be wheel-thrown, and (ibid., 192, fig. 3.6) shows them reconstructed as pot-stands. Similar inscribed wheel- thrown objects with a central aperture were found by Petrie at Naukratis: (Petrie et al. 1886: pl. xxxiv:661, 638, 646, 648  and 644; GR 1910.2-22.233, 241, 243 and probably 239 ; Schlotzhauer and Villing 2006: 65,  figs 43 and 44). They probably served the same purpose as our hand- modelled versions, but they are not catalogued here. Of a much  thinner fabric than ours and probably not relevant is Schäfer 1901:  151–2, with a Coptic inscription reading ‘I am Prankeros. I have  offered this vessel to our god.’.
An alternative interpretation has been suggested for parallels from Memphis have been interpreted as grips for pump  drills (Anthes & Bakry 1959, 48, pl. 30, nos. 222-3).

Marshall in the BM inscription catalogue read the word as 'τῷ χώρῳ', that is 'village/local district'. Thallos remains an official of some form, a local magistrate or official (according to Ascough et al. 2012, no. 110), through whether he was an artist is less certain - this does not change the the likely nature of the event being commemorated, a religious festival with drama and music.

It probably once lined a processional way leading to the entrance of the Great Temenos.
In his journal, Petrie describes the discovery: “Then out in front of the great building of Ptolemy, at the gate of the Great Temenos  I have found a large sphinx; upper part gone, but 7 feet long: beside two halves of another marble ram. I now believe, what I had suspected from the two rams found at the entrance before, that an avenue of sphinxes & rams led up to the building of Philadelphos, from the canal landing place” (Petrie 1885-1886, p. 18-19). Gardner (1888, 13-14) gives further details and notes about the find of two further large fragments: ""A broad and long trench was made along the probable direction of this avenue [the sacred road]; and in it was found the lower part of a granite sphinx, of the Ptolemaic period. The sphinx had been split up, in order that the stone might be used for other purposes; even on the part left wedge-holes could be seen, intended to serve for splitting off another portion. But this destruction must have taken place at some remote period, for the sphinx was about six feet below the present level of the ground. By a later search two large portions that have been broken off were recovered , and then were restored to their original position - not without some difficulty, for they could only just be lifted by six or seven men. Thus the whole sphinx again stood complete, with the exception of the face on, which could not be found.""
Thus reconstituted, the sphinx was photographed by Petrie (Delta series nos 488 and 489).
A criosphinx figure would fit well with the cult of the major god revered in the Great Temenos, the ram-headed god Amun-Ra Baded (Yoyotte 1982/83; Guermeur 2005, 126-138). However, from what can be guessed from the photographs, it seems that it was a human-headed sphinx and would have represented the pharaoh, possibly Ptolemy I or II.

The king is depicted wearing the nemes headcloth with a single uraeus, with the head and coiled body of the cobra displayed at the centre above the king’s forehead. There appears to be another wig or headdress visible underneath the lappets of the nemes which is set low against the forehead, and at the ends of the cloth where another layer of stone is clearly indicated. On the reverse, the headdress tapers into a pointed end in low relief. The right arm is held across the chest with the thumb resting against the index finger, though there is no item depicted in the clenched hand. The left arm appears to be placed by the king’s side, and thus he may have originally been depicted in a seated or standing position. The face is rounded, with narrow almond shaped eyes and modelled eyebrows which are indicated in a straight line across the brow. The nose is broad, and the thick lips are curved into a subtle smile. At the chin, the king wears a long stylised false beard. On the reverse are the remains of the upper section of a broad back-pillar which is uninscribed.

In addition to the loss of the right shoulder and arm, there is further damage to the king’s beard, chin and left side of the nemes headcloth as well as the uraeus cobra. The ears of the statue are possibly unfinished, with a channel of potentially unworked(?) stone visible behind the lobes.",,,,,,,Ptolemaic,286BC-246BC,Made in: Egypt,Found/Acquired: Egypt,calcite,,,,"Height: 74.50 centimetres object and base ; Height: 64.50 centimetres object ; Weight: 114 kilograms object and base ; Width: 45.70 centimetres object and base (object overhangs base) ; Width: 38 centimetres object ; Depth: 24.50 centimetres base ; Depth: 31 centimetres object ",,"The authenticity of this statue was once debated given the peculiarities of the double headdress, the positioning of the right hand, and the length and rendering of the false beard; however, most now agree that this is a genuine sculpture of the first millennium BC. 

The atypical choice of stone for the sculpture is also noteworthy. Roughly of life-sized height and composition, other hypotheses have suggested that the statue was a representation of Nectanebo II (Josephson 1997), however it is now generally agreed that the surviving features are consistent with other surviving images of Ptolemy II. Archaising artistic tendencies are typical of statues from the Late Period onwards, which harken back to the appearance and style of monuments from the Old Kingdom; it has been proposed that this statue of Ptolemy II is directly influenced by the images of the 3rd Dynasty king Djoser (Baines and Riggs 2001), though others have argued against this suggestion (Ashton 2003). 

Though the provenance of the statue is unknown, Saqqara has been tentatively suggested as a possible context (Baines and Riggs; Taylor 2008; and noted as possible within Strudwick 2006).

This rustic god is typically depicted nude apart from his cloak (see LIMC 8, 923-41), with typical Cypriot examples including BM C 230 - also from Idalion but of 3rd century date - as well as several others found by Lang in the sanctuary of Apollo at Pyla (Caubet 1974, 173-174 and pl. XXVIII:5-6). The tunic on this example was attributed to 'Cypriote prudishness' by Pryce (1931, 93) but may also reflect a different iconographic source and/or a specific Cypriot cult adaptation. The leaner facial features of C231 probably indicates a later fourth century date (Tatton-Brown 2007, 177), a relatively early date for this type on Cyprus which may also explain the clothed form. 
See Counts 2008 and 2010a (esp. 138; fig. 5) on this iconographic type on Cyprus and its relationship with earlier images of the local Master of the Animals with whom Pan was identified.

If correct - since not all Pryce's provenances can be accepted at face value - this head was probably found in one of two sanctuaries to a female deity excavated by Max Ohnefalsch-Richter at Idalion in 1883. One was a shrine dedicated to another female deity (labelled by the excavator as 'Aphrodite kourotrophos' based on the finds of limestone figures of seated goddesses holding children) who he believed was worshipped alongside Adonis-Tammuz; this sanctuary was plocated on the hill immediately to the west of the Western acropolis of Idalion (1891, 18 no. 33 and pl. II, 15) and apparently relocated by the American Expedition to Idalion in the 1970s (Beer 1997). The other was a small cult-place located on the Eastern Acropolis - below what the excavator described as 'the principal sanctuary of the Idalion Aphrodite' - which produced a 'developed Greek style' limestone head 'rather more than half as large as life' (Ohnefalsch-Richter 1891, 17 no. 31 and pl. III, 7). 
This might be the present item, though this is uncertain because precise identification of the subject is difficult in the absence of the body (see Connelly 1988, 21-2 for this problem) and she might be a votary, priestess or honorand or else a goddess. As such, Ohnefalsch-Richter's identification of the head he describes as proof of the dedication of the shrine on the Eastern Acropolis (his site no. 31) would also be uncertain.  
See Connelly 1988 for an analysis of Hellenistic votive statues on Cyprus; also Hermary 1989, 375-82 for additional examples of veiled female statues. Dillon 2010 passim for a broader discussion of female portraits in the Greek world.

The figure is depicted with a receding hairline, with closely cropped and thick curled hair at the top and sides of the head and notable modelling of the skull particularly around the forehead. The almond shaped eyes are detailed with a thin incised rim around the upper eyelid, and set underneath the deeply defined ridges of the arched eyebrows. There is a discernible furrowing of the figure’s brow emphasised by the crease at the bridge of the nose. The face is fleshy with notable ridges of skin around the nose and mouth area, and is particularly rounded at the jawline. The mouth is small with thick lips and the outer corners are curved slightly into a small smile. On the reverse, a fragment likely from the top of a back-pillar is partly preserved at the base of the figure’s neck.

An example of this can be seen here with the use of the Greek curled hairstyle, which has led to suggestions that this head is an example of an individualised portrait from the Ptolemaic Period (though differing suggestions include ‘early-mid’ Ptolemaic, PM VIII; or late Ptolemaic, Russmann 2001). ‘Portrait heads’ of other non-royal male figures also include similar indications of an older age through the additional details of wrinkles and folds of the skin; later collectors often removed these heads from the original bodies as they valued the ‘Roman’ appearance of such sculpture (Russmann 2001).

The provenance of the head, said by the owner to have originated from Tell Basta in Lower Egypt, has been questioned in other sources (Russmann 2001: 259, n.1).

The figure is depicted with short stylised curly hair, set high on the forehead and with the small sized ears exposed. The detailed curls follow a slightly irregular line across the brow. The facial features have been executed to a high quality, with subtle modelling of the youthful skin across the forehead, slightly sunken skin under the eyes, prominent cheekbones, and a pronounced jawline. The eyes are wide and almond shaped, with a heavy upper eyelid and sharply defined brow which is set close to the eyes and converges with the bridge of the nose. The hooked nose is long and slim, with a clear cupid’s bow at the upper lip. The lips are slightly parted with a much fuller lower lip, and the outer corners and lower lip sharply incised. On the reverse the curled hairstyle continues down the nape of the neck, and there appears to be no surviving trace of a back-pillar.

The stylistic features and the contrast of the smoothed face and unpolished curls of the hair are noted to resemble other surviving heads which combine Egyptian and Greek artistic characteristics (James and Davies 1983).

The head is described as originating from Alexandria, however a more precise findspot is uncertain (PM VIII).

The short side at the bottom is rounded. The top of the pillar, where the mask was attached, must have jutted out to accommodate the head, which would explain the broken, proud surface at the rear.",,,,,,,Hellenistic; Roman,100 BC-100 AD,Made in: Cyprus,Found/Acquired: Lefka,limestone,,,carved,"Height: 89 centimetres; Weight: 107 kilograms approx. ; Thickness: 25 centimetres max. ; Width: 61 centimetres max. ",,"The abraded surface of the head makes precise dating difficult, as the only well preserved details are on the sides. The carving of the hair resembles to some degree that found on male votive statues of the later fifth century BC. This would be exceptionally early for a representation of Dionysos on Cyprus, even if the image itself is the older iconographic form of the god. Professor Antoine Hermary has advised (pers. comm.) that it is more like to belong to the late Hellenistic or early Roman periods, though perhaps carved within an archaistic tradition which would explain the 'early' iconographic form of the god as a bearded male.       
See Karageorghis 1984 for a survey of the archaeological evidence for Dionysos on Cyprus which was probably introduced during Hellenistic times as a means of bolstering support for the Ptolemaic dynasty who claimed descent from the god. Bennett 1980, 385-90 discusses mainly the epigraphic and cultic aspects of the god.
The head was found built into the camel station in the village of Lefka in north-west Cyprus. It may have been removed from the ruins of ancient Soloi on the coast to the north-west of the village, from a sanctuary or from a public building such as the theatre, though this cannot be confirmed. Alternatively, the head may also have been set up in a grove or rural sanctuary from the archaeologically-rich area around the modern village. 
See Westholm 1934, 399-411 on the topography and historical sources of Soloi, and 412ff on the seminal Swedish excavations there; also Des Gagniers in Des Gagniers and Tinh 1985, xiii-xliii for a more recent survey. Gunnis reported various inscribed funeral cippi in a graveyard (possibly connected to one of the village mosques) of Lefka, taken he said from the 'vast Hellenistic and Roman necropolis which surrounds the town' (Gunnis 1947, 320). However, he follows this by mentioning material from the ancient burial grounds around the villages of Katydhata and Linou in the adjacent valley to the east of Lefka (cf. Myres and Ohnefalsch-Richter 1899, 4), so it is not entirely clear what cemeteries he is referring to and he may be confusing two distinct areas.

GR] The head was acquired from a villagers in Lefka in 1889 by Henry Tubbs in partnership with Charles Christian (q.v.) when the former was running the Cyprus Exploration Fund season at Polis. It was sent to the Museum on the S.S. Arcadia the same year (GR Original Letters 1889, 70c, Christian to Alexander Murray, 8 June; see also also Original Letters 1889, no. 270, Tubbs to Murray, 23 May when the writer alludes to on-going negotiations with the owner). It was not formally registered until 1910 when the Trustees finally authorised its purchase from Tubbs (who had moved to Australia in 1890). This delay is possibly because of the very worn condition of the face of the statue which may have made Murray or his colleagues reluctant to pay for it. In a letter of 1891, Tubbs says that he was 'disgusted' when he saw it 'in the cellars' (presumably meaning the Museum stores) for the first time since he arranged to buy it in Cyprus. He seems to have purchased the sculpture in a hurry after seeing it 'in a blinding glare of sunlight built into a house wall' (GR Original Letters 1891, no. 302, Tubbs to Murray, 21 Sept.) and so perhaps did not take full cognizance of its worn condition.",,Greek and Roman,,"1910,1014.1",,,

Townley's description; ‘A head, the size of large life, with an heroic countenance, expressing great agitation of mind, which with the violent twist of the neck, and the eager cast upwards of the face, might suit the character and situations of a Diomedes, or an Ajax, but tho’ it is uncertain what the subject was of the Statue, to which this head belonged, it certainly must have been in great action, exceeding perhaps that of the Gladiator or the Laocoon.  the sculpture of this head is equal to any remains of ancient art.  it was found along with a few small pieces of the statue by Mr Gavin Hamilton in the Pantanella before mentioned’ (The first Townley inventory, Heads 19). 
Several mythological identifications for this head were proposed by Townley:
 - Titan: ‘the character of this head is suitable to that of the Titan in groupes of Minerva, fighting with those fictitious beings’ (1804 Parlour Catalogue, park drawing room 38}
- ‘Head of a Homeric hero’: In ‘Companion of Ulysses’ (TY 14/5/13), he hit the mark, as shown by the discovery of a duplicate in the cave of Tiberius at Sperlonga.
- On Townley drawing 2010,5006.215, the bust is marked ‘Diomedes’.
Excavated by Gavin Hamilton in the Pantanella at Hadrian’s villa, probably in 1769 as Townley reports in (TY 10/8), although he gives the date as 1770 in TY 10/3 (fo. 18) and Bodleian Ms Add D 71 (fo. 200), and as 1771 in ST 2 and TY 12/19/1.

Europa riding the bull-figure of Zeus
Babylon, Iraq
Possibly 1st century BC – 1st century AD
This is a scene from Classical mythology. Europa was said to be the daughter of a Phoenician king who was abducted by the Greek god Zeus who took the form of a bull. She was carried off to Crete and their sons were said to have included king Minos. The delicate colouring includes a blue veil, pink flesh, red base, and black on the borders of the veil and on the bull's head. This combination of colours and Classical mythology are clear evidence for Greek influence on local arts and crafts following the conquest by Alexander in the 3rd century BC. However, the frontal style of this object is non-Classical and the object therefore probably dates to the early Parthian period.

The Buchis bull was one of several sacred bulls, the most famous being the Apis bull at Memphis. Bulls were symbolic of physical strength and were associated with male fertility. The Buchis bull was sacred to Montu, and lived at Armant, south of Thebes. Like the Apis, there was only one Buchis bull at a time. He was identified by special markings, a white body and black face. Macrobius, a Roman writer living in about AD 400, records the unlikely information that the bulls changed colour hourly, and had hair which grew backwards.
When it died, the Buchis bull was mummified and placed in a catacomb known as the Bucheum. Each burial was marked by one or more stelae, just like those put up for human tombs. This one shows the king offering bread to the bull, who stands behind an offering table laden with the food to sustain him through eternity. The information on these stelae helped Sir Robert Mond and Walter Bryan Emery to determine the dates of the burials, when they discovered the Bucheum in 1927. The catacombs that they found were used from the time of Nectanebo II (reigned 360-343 BC) to that of Diocletian (AD 284-305), a period of over 600 years.

Before him is an offering stand stacked with slices of bread and surrounded by hieroglyphs for the invocation-of-offerings formula that will supply him with bread and beer, flesh and fowl, linen garments, incense and unguent in the afterlife. The hieroglyphs before his face supply his titles, name and parentage, and describe the ritual he carries out as 'adoring the god four times'. The deities depicted from left to right, all named and with lengthy epithets, are Osiris, Apis,  Isis, Nephthys, Horus, Anubis, Imhotep, deified architect of the first pyramid; and the falcon of the West. All of them grant Pasherenptah otherworldly blessings. The frame at the left is composed of the palm rib, the hieroglyph for 'a year', with Heh, god of millions, in characteristic pose at its base, the whole symbolically wishing the deceased millions of years in the afterlife. The frame at the right is the 'was'-sceptre. The fourteen rows of superbly carved hieroglyphs begin with a standard funerary offering formula on behalf of  Pasherenptah,  whose numerous titles are listed in full, and continue with a conventional address to the living.

Pasherenptah's autobiography describes how, immediately after his appointment as high priest of Ptah at the age of fourteen, he performed the coronation of Cleopatra's father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, in 76 BC in accordance with the ancient pharaonic rituals. When Pasherenptah went to Alexandria, the King stopped his chariot en route to the temple of Isis to show him personal favour by rewarding him with a gold chaplet and appointing him priest of the royal cult. The hieroglyph for 'ride in a chariot' occurring twice in line 10 is a particularly fine Ptolemaic example of the graphic nature of the script. Subsequently, Auletes and his family visited Memphis to take part in local festivals in which the High Priest undoubtedly played an important role. When Pasherenptah had reached the age of forty-three, he and his wife were still without a male child, but Imhotep answered their prayers and the son was named in the god's honour. The intercession of Imhotep presumably explains his appearance among the deities at the top of the stela: although after deification the architect of the first pyramid was made the son of Ptah and so had particular relevance for Ptah's priesthood, Paherenptah obviously looked upon him as a personal god. The High Priest's death took place in year 11 of Cleopatra VII, precisely on 14 July 41 BC, and it is of interest that the embalming process took eighty days rather than the seventy usually considered the optimum time. The inscription also provides the information that the text was composed by Pasherenptah's brother-in-law Horimhotep and carved by the deceased's own nephew Khahap.","Bibliography:

The accompanying male wears a circle of cobras crown, an echloned tripartite wig and vulture headdress and body over the wig.

Both have exceptionally large ears; the female has a small chin, bulging cheeks and fleshy nose, and the ruler has large eyes, a straight, upturned mouth and hooked nose with large nostrils.

Györy (2002: 77) states that the group of hieroglyphs inscribed on the face of the pier were cut before firing, but this is not so. The text must have been copied from a printed edition of the Middle Kingdom Instructions of Khety, concerning the advantages of being a scribe, and is discussed by H.W. Fischer-Elfert in Györy 2002: 94–5, who was needlessly concerned about the possibility of a version of these Instructions being available in Ptolemaic times. 
Ptolemaic, probably second to first century BC.

Györy's comparanda are not all of the same mould-series as ours, and some of them are male.
