St Cosmo's 'big toe'
Wax ex votos from Isernia, southern Italy 
On 17 July 1781 Sir William Hamilton wrote to Joseph Banks, President of the Royal   Society, notifying him that he had, as he thought, discovered 'the Cult of Priapus in as full vigour, as in the days of the Greeks and Romans, at Isernia in Abruzzo'. He goes on to  explain that the  cult consisted of an ancient festival in reverence of St Cosmo's 'big toe', a local euphemism for a phallus. It is not known what was meant exactly by this. Perhaps it was a relic of the saint, or another term for the wax models of male genitalia that were sold at the festival for dedication in the shrine.
Hamilton had got to hear of the 'cult' through an engineer who was supervising the construction of a new road through Isernia. Assuming the cult had its origins in antiquity, Sir William asked the governor of the town to make a search for evidence of an ancient temple hear St Cosmo's shrine. The search was fruitless, but a number of inscriptions were copied in the process, and Hamilton passed on a record of these to the Royal Society. He also sent a copy of the eye-witness report of the festival. This was subsequently published, with Sir William's explanation, by the Society of Dilettanti in a volume that principally consisted of a Discourse on the Worship of Priapus by Hamilton's younger contemporary Richard Payne Knight.
Sir William explains how an annual fair lasting three days was held at the shrine of SS Cosmo and Damiano. Relics of the saints were exposed and then carried in procession from the cathedral to the shrine: In the city, and at the fair, ex voti of wax, representing the male parts of generation, of various dimensions, some even of the length of a palm, are publicly offered for sale. There are also waxen vows, that represent other parts of the body mixed with them .... The devout distributers of the vows carry a basket full of them in one 	hand, and hold a plate in the other to receive the money, crying aloud, 'St Cosmo and Damiano!' If you ask the price of one, the answer is, più ci metti, più meriti: 'The more you give, the more's the merit' ... The Vows are chiefly presented by the female sex, and they are seldom such as represent legs, arms, etc, but more commonly the male parts of regeneration. Hamilton goes on to explain how prayers are said as the votive is handed over. One woman was heard to say 'Blessed St Cosmo, let it be like this'. Other worshippers approach the great altar to receive unction with the oil of St Cosmo,  exposing the afflicted part of the body, 'not even excepting that which is most frequently represented by the ex voti'.
Hamilton had not himself been present at the festival proceedings and, between his first becoming aware of it and the Dilettanti Society's publication, the rites were suppressed by the local Catholic clergy. (Eventually Isernia itself was to be destroyed in an earthquake that struck the area on 26 July 1805.) Sir William did, however, manage to acquire  some  of the  wax  ex  votos.  He deposited five of these in the British Museum when he was in England in  1784, with instructions to the Revd Dr Paul Henry Maty,   Keeper  of Natural  and  Artificial Productions, to 'keep hands off of them'. The intentional irony of this remark shows that, although Sir William was in earnest about his claims to have discovered a survival of an ancient cult, and therefore wished to see the ex votos placed alongside his collection of ancient 'Priapi' in the Museum, he nonetheless saw the funny side of it all. Earlier he had signed a letter to Joseph Banks with the wish that his 'big toe' may never fail him.
No contemporary record in the Museum has been found of Sir William's gift, but a register compiled in the second part of the nineteenth century does include it. This document lists erotic objects principally in the collection of George Witt, presented to the Museum in   1865,  but also in other collections, Sir William's included.  It is noted that two, M.562 and M.563, were broken.
Subsequently, it seems, all five of these unusually fragile objects were reduced to fragments. Their original appearance can, however be seen in the engraving that formed the frontispiece to the Dilettanti Society's publication.
Sir William, it seems, was not the only collector to acquire examples of St Cosmo's 'big toe'. The Witt collection itself contains two (Witt.319-20) which are carefully preserved by virtue of the case made especially for them. These are identical with pieces in the engraving and show that more than one cast was struck from the master mould taken from any one member.

No decoration visible on hair. Large ears which may have earrings fixed to lobes of ear.

Although this piece is most likely not from Naukratis itself, it nevertheless belongs with a number of other finely executed aryballoi, which form a distinct group within the sixth century faience industry. It is one of a range of mixed-style heads which have very finely observed features, and which display details of modelling which link them closely to the conventions of Saite sculpture. The best comparison is the glazed composition Achelous head aryballos from Kawa in Nubia, now Oxford Ashmolean, 1931.482. (Webb 1978, no 845; Boardman 1999, fig. 148, 127.) This displays the same shaped hair-line as the Boston piece, a shape which was considered typical of the black African, for it imitates the hair line of a closely shaven head, and  can also be seen on some of the moulds from the scarab factory at Naukratis, though in cruder form. (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, nos 8 & 9; Gorton fig.35, nos. 2 and 3 in top line.) However, since this second piece (from Kawa in Nubia) represents the bull-headed river god Achelous, the hair line is stretched right down to the beard and neck.  The modelling of the face, particularly the eyes, is very subtle, and like our Boston head, can only find adequate comparisons with Saite sculpture (Bothmer 1960, figs. 65-67, pls. 28-9, and passim.) Other features are the elongated, almond shaped eyes, with projecting cosmetic lines at the outer corners, while the perforation holes at either side of the mouth have parallels with both Egyptian sculpture (Dows Dunham 1950, Canopic head vase, Ku 16. 19.3, 573, pl. 37, F.) and Egyptian contemporary work in glass (Journal of Glass Studies, 2 (1960), fig. 14, p. 22-3.)
Other related pieces, also with depictions of  black African heads, are the glazed composition vases in the form of a Nubian and a Syrian head, back to back (Webb 1978, nos. 874, 875). However, these are not such finely modelled studies, although there is the same hair line, here with the addition of internal detail represented as of African type with incised squares/diamonds and a central dot in each cell. One of the two wears circular earrings, as suspected for the Boston piece (Webb 1978, 875, pl. XX) and facial features are similarly if more crudely represented.
 Other pieces can also be compared with our black African head- a group of vases where a girl's head is combined with various monsters. (Webb 1978, 131, nos 880-883.) These include (in the depiction of the girl) cosmetic lines on the eyes, a mouth with perforations at either corner, and carefully modelled ears. There is also a series of helmeted head aryballoi. (Webb 1978, nos. 840-844) which similarly have almond shaped eyes, and charmingly combine Greek-style helmets with Egyptian decoration.
To sum up,  the Boston aryballos in the form of the head of a Black African belongs with a finely modelled group of head vases, which are part of the sixth century faience aryballoi industry, and demonstrate close links with Egyptian sculpture of the Saite period. They are distributed in both Egypt, Cyprus, Rhodes, Aigina, and Italy as well as probable Black Sea sites.We should not be wrong in assigning these to  workshops established in a part of Egypt where Greek influence was strong, but was willingly mixed with local traditions, and where trading links with the Mediterranean were vibrant.  
Unfortunately, we have no dated contexts for any of these aryballoi. We can only suggest that there are stylistic links with the cartouched aryballoi, which although they appear to bear the cartouche Wa ib re (Apries) (589-570) may in fact be dated to the second quarter of the sixth century.; Aryballoi in faience are a rare find in Naukratis. Amongst the four hedgehog aryballoi said to come from Naukratis, only BM 1886.0401.1501 can be assuredly assigned to the site (Webb 1978, 133, no. 905, pl. 21), while the provenance of the aryballoi kept in Edinburgh, Copenhagen and New York is highly doubtful (Webb forthcoming). To the British Museum specimen can be added two fragments of spherical aryballoi kept at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (Eg.Inv.3623-3624). 
All these examples of finds actually made on the site of Naukratis demonstrate the poor conditions of preservation which prevailed there -either due to damp and their making up part of what were rubbish dumps in antiquity, or the damage caused by the conditions prevailing in the 1880's when the Sebakhin were extracting the rich soil for fertiliser. Their fragmentary condition makes it even less likely that complete examples  can be assigned a findspot from Naukratis itself, although this does not rule out the possibility of their manufacture there. See the comment on fragmentary hedgehog aryballoi noted by Edgar in piles of rubbish near the scarab factory. (Hogarth 1905, 134). 
Such containers were very popular in the Mediterranean world especially during the 6th century BC and belong to the Phase III in the Archaic Greek Faience typology by Webb (Webb 1978, 133–5; Webb forthcoming; Pierrat-Bonnefois forthcoming). Apart Naukratis, other Egyptian sites provided aryballoi in faience, such as Tell el Yehudiyeh and Thebes (Webb 1978, nos 907–915).

It is 22 inches high and 16 inches in diameter, and was brought from Rome by Lord Cawdor’ (1804 Parlour Catalogue, street parlour 12).  ‘This article is not worthy of the collection in which it is placed.  It was originally the capital of an ancient column, but it owes its present form and appearance to the taste and skill of Piranesi.  It was sold as an antique urn by the Manufacturer to Lord Cawdor, from whose hands it passed into those of Mr. Townley.  I had this anecdote from Mr. Gresham, who actually saw Piranesi engaged in the fabrication of this forgery’ (Combe, ms note in the interleaved copy of the 1808 Synopsis in the Department of Greece and Rome, Room II.14).
Bought by Townley at the sale of the collection of the first Baron Cawdor (First Day’s Sale, lot 18) for £14.14s. The auction was conducted by Skinner & Dyke on 5-6 June 1800 (TY 19/109).

The family name recalls that of the notorious Locusta, arch-poisoner of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. According to Tacitus (Annals 12.66), she served Agrippina in concocting the poison that killed the emperor Claudius; later she assisted Nero in his murder of the young Britannicus (Suetonius, Life of Nero, 33).

The other Centaur on the right rears up with forefeet planted on the shoulders of Kaineus, and left hind foot striking at his shield; with both arms he swings a great rock above his left shoulder, hurling it down on the Lapith. Behind him a large pine-tree lies obliquely across the design. Both the Centaurs have long wavy hair and bushy beard; the wounded one is bald over the temples, and has the ends of his hair tied with a fillet. On the left a second Lapith with shield (half seen, in perspective; device, a horse galloping to left in silhouette) and uplifted spear charges to left, attacking an opponent who is not shown; he has a helmet of which the crown is in silhouette, with a spiral ornament in red, and a heavy sword at his thigh.

He is bearded and wears a short chiton and cuirass, as well as being equipped with a double-crested Chalcidian helmet with a black caul, a shield (decorated with an ivy wreath) and greaves. His head and torso are frontal, his legs in profile. Red blood pours from the wound in his stomach. His teeth are shown and his eyes are beginning to turn up into his head; his sword arm seems to have lost its strength.
Border: two reserved lines.

Hartwig attributed the cup to Chachrylion; Beazley gave it to his Epidromos Painter. Williams has argued that it is, together with the other works of Beazley's Epidromos Painter, an early work of Apollodoros (JHS97 [1977] 163-4). Bloesch placed this cup type C in his 'fortschrittliche Richtung', but the shape also recalls his Apollodoros Class (FAS 127).
The helmet worn by the fallen warrior is of particular interest. Crests mounted widthways on helmets are fairly common, especially in the western Greek world, but double lengthways crests are much rarer (e.g. Oxford, Guy fragments: Onesimos). The crest-holders here have a series of short lines on one side of a vertical dividing line that suggests that they are intended to be horns, while below them are what can only really be large ears. Helmets with horns and ears are known on Athenian vases from the sixth century (e.g. C. Blinkenberg, Lindos: Fouilles de I'acropole 1902-1914. I Les Petits Objets [Berlin 1931] pl. 127 no. 2618, Corinthian type with feathers and bull's horns - see further R.M. Cook, Clazomenian Sarcophagi [Mainz 1981] 124 note 108) and the fifth century (e.g. ARV2 185, 36, Corinthian type with central crest and ram's horns; 364, 43, Corinthian type with central crest and bull's horns; Beazley Add2 393, Chairestratos, Geneva market, Corinthian type with central crest and bull's horns and ears [attributed to Douris by Bothmer]; once Basel market, Eye of Greece 37 no. 142 A, as last; 860, 5, Attic-Phrygian type, with bull's horns and ears; Berlin 1970.9 [Triptolemos Painter], Corinthian type with central crest and bull's horns and ears). They are also found on Clazomenian sarcophagi (Cook op. cit. 124) and on a marble relief fragment from the Archaic Artemision at Ephesos (F.N. Pryce, Catalogue of Sculpture in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities of the British Museum [London 1928] no. Β 174). Some actual helmets also survive: H. Pflug, Schutz und Zier (Basel 1981) no. 81 (seventh-century Corinthian); W. Wrede et al., Olympiabericht 1 (Berlin 1937) pl. 12 (fragment: seventh-century Corinthian); P. Gercke (ed.), Funde aus der Antike. Sammlung Paul Dierichs (Kassel 1981) no. 45 (fifth-century Corinthian). None of them, however, show the arrangement seen here, where the crests are attached to the horns.

In October of that year they visited the Castle of St Peter at Bodrum to assess, on behalf of the British Ambassador at Constantinople, Stratford Canning, whether it was possible to remove the slabs originally from the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, which had been incorporated into the wall of the castle. Unable to gain authorisation by the Turkish authorities to enter the castle, Dadd was only able to draw the four slabs visible from the outside. Phillips sent his report, which included the four drawings by Dadd, to Canning. The drawings, which are now lost, were passed on to Walter Devereux. In 1844 permission to enter the Castle was finally granted to Canning’s Oriental Secretary, Charles Alison, together with Devereux. Devereux made sketches of seven slabs and had them lithographed together with Dadd’s drawings, or rather his copies of Dadd’s drawings, for his 1847 publication 'Views on the shores of the Mediterranean'.

This fragment is engraved in Edward Dodwell, 'A Classical and Topographical Tour through Greece, during the years 1801, 1805, and 1806', (London, 1819), Vol. 2, p.232: '...A mass [note 2: 'It is in the British Museum. See the annexed plate.'] of green marble was found by the excavators of the Earl of Elgin near the treasury of Atreus. It is enriched with the spiral maeander and some circular ornaments similar to those over the column of the gate of the lions. The spiral ornament is supposed to be symbolic of water; the pointed or zigzag ornament, which accompanies it on the pilaster of the treasury of Atreus, is probably emblematical of fire; and thus the two elements are united, as they also appear to be upon the sculptured marble over the portal of the acropolis...' p. 240",,Not on display,,,sculpture,,Associated with: Treasury of Atreus,,,Purchased from: R Gilbertson,,,Previous owner/ex-collection: Edward Dodwell,1962,Officer's Reports 30 March 1962,,Greek and Roman,,"2012,5019.1.62",,,

		'...We sailed in the open boat all through a very stormy day, and arrived at  last at Tinos (the town), thoroughly chilled and wet. The island, once highly  prosperous, is now poor and depopulated...From Tinos we sailed across to Great Delos (Rhenea), slept in a hut, and next day went on to Little Delos. Here there was nothing to sleep in but the sail of the boat, and nothing to eat at all. Everything on the island had been  bought up by an English frigate a few days before. We were obliged to send  across to Great Delos for a kid, which was killed and roasted by us in the Temple of Apollo. I spent my time sketching and measuring everything I  could see in the way of architectural remains, and copying every inscription.  I had to work hard, but without house or food we could not stop where we  were, and in the evening we sailed to Mycone.
		Next day I went back to Delos, and after much consideration resolved totry  to dig there. I had to sleep in the open air, for the company of the diggers in  the hut was too much for me. First I made out the columns of the temple and  drew a restoration plan. Then we went on digging, but discovered next to nothing - a beautiful fragment of a hand, a dial, some glass, copper, lead,  &c., and vast masses of marble chips, as though it had once been a marble- mason's shop. At last it seemed to promise so little that I gave it up and went  back to Mycone; but on the 28th, not liking to be beaten, I went back alone to have a last look. But I could discover no indications to make further digging hopeful, so I came away...'

Unable to embark for Greece because of unfavourable weather and  political conditions, Elgin's team of artists spent four months in Sicily working in Agrigento and Syracuse. They made a cast of  this sarcophagus which came to the British Museum with the rest of  the Elgin collection in 1816. It was registered 1816,0610,401 but  cannot now be located. See  P. Hunt & A. H.

All three volumes are bound in brown leather and have pages of blue paper onto which the drawings have been pasted. Nearly all the drawings are annotated with the name of the villa or palace where the sculptures were housed at the time they were drawn, and in some cases there are further annotations in a different hand, which were written at a later date, correcting this information.
The volumes had been in the collection of Charles Townley and were acquired by the British Museum in 1814. Townley purchased two of these volumes from the banker and fellow-collector Lyde Browne in 1783 (see Jenkins 2006). A record in Townley’s account book (TY8/5) tells us that on 14 October 1783 he paid Lyde Browne eight pounds and four shillings for ‘two folios of various drawings from ancient monuments’, and an entry in the ‘Union Catalogue’ (in the possession of Simon Towneley) dated 2 October 1783 reads: ‘To Mr Lyde Browne for two large portfol. full of drawings from ancient monuments formerly belonged to Dr Mead --- [£]8.4.0’. 
Ian Jenkins has identified these volumes with a group of drawings described as “a large and curious collection of drawings from the antique, in 5 port folios, all pasted on blue paper” in the sale catalogue of Richard Mead’s Prints and Drawings (8th Night, Tuesday 21 January, 1755, lot 70). A copy of the catalogue in the Getty Research Institute has been annotated and states that they were sold for £21.10.6 and that they were formerly Mr Tophams. We do not know precisely how Mead acquired these volumes, but he was a kinsman of Topham and one of the executors of his will. How Townley acquired the third volume, and where the two missing volumes are, remains unknown. 
Jenkins made a further discovery, which was that the majority of the drawings in the three volumes appear to be preparatory studies of finished drawings, commissioned by Richard Topham, which are now in Eton College Library. Topham kept a record of the draughtsman of each drawing he commissioned and from this we know that nearly all the drawings in the three volumes are by Bernardino Ciferri, who favoured red chalk, and Carlo Calderi, who used black chalk. 
This drawing is a preparatory drawing of ECL-Bm.6:55-2012
Volume 1 (2015,5015.1.1-146) consists of 146 drawings.

If the Athenian swords were not longer than this, they had little reason to deride those of the Spartans, which, according to Plutarch [note 2: Life of Lycurgus], was the case. The sword which I found resembles the parazonion or heroic sword, often represented on the sculpture and the vases of the Greeks. The length of the Athenian swords was doubled by order of Iphicrates. That which I found is probably therefore of very remote antiquity [note 3: Diodor. Sic. b. 15.c.44. Iphicrates died about three hundred and eighty years before Christ].

The Queen of Sheba before King Solomon, c.1798
Pen and ink over graphite with brown wash, 517 x 522 mm
PD 1854-2-11-82
Purchased from Dr Granville
Ghiberti is a towering figure in the forefront of the artistic and intellectual revolution of the Italian Renaissance. The Queen of Sheba before Solomon is one of ten panels of his masterpiece, the doors known as the ‘Gates of Paradise’ (after Michelangelo’s description of them), which were designed c.1425-52 for the Baptistery of the Duomo in Florence. The panels are based on episodes from the Old Testament. Ghiberti achieved a remarkable perspective by modelling the foreground almost in the round while treating the background elements in the shallowest of relief. The panels were cast in bronze and gilded to shimmering effect. The doors remained in situ until the 19th century, but they have since been removed to the adjoining Museo dell’Opera del Duomo.	
	The monumental architecture is a curious hybrid of Classical and Gothic styles. The stillness and the perfect symmetry of the composition create a sense of utmost solemnity. The meeting is presented with a strong sense of purpose: Sheba has come to test Solomon “with hard questions” (I Kings 10:1). Her crown is hidden from his gaze and she is presented as a veiled Madonna-like figure.
	The present artist came from the Russian-Chinese border but based himself in Karlsruhe in Germany and travelled widely in Greece, Italy and England. He established a reputation for his work after sculpture, especially the antique. Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin (1766-1841) employed him to make drawings after sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens. Like Elgin’s celebrated collection of Greek and Roman sculpture, several albums of Kalmyck’s sketches are also in the British Museum. In about 1798 a set of etchings was published after the ‘Gates of Paradise’ and the present drawing - slightly less than life-size - is the design for one of these. Kalmyck has imitated Ghiberti’s contrasts of shallow and high relief, applying brown washes to indicate the deep shadows around the principal figures while drawing the architecture in line only. Early Renaissance art had fallen out of fashion by the 18th century and this publication is an example of the renewed interest that was to develop to a huge extent in the following decades.",,Not on display,"Exhibited:

See: Edward Dodwell, 'A Classical and Topographical Tour through  Greece, during the years 1801, 1805, and 1806', (London, 1819): 'Near the port of Zea on the northern side of the Piraeus, are the   remains of walls and two round towers...These towers were  separated by a gate which probably constituted the entrance to the  great cemeter, or Nekropolis of the Piraeus, which extends a  considerable way towards Mount Aigaleos, in a northern direction. At  the northern extremity of the burying-ground is a low rocky hill  covered with sepulchres, which are concealed by the soil and weeds;  and where some broken sarcophagi are found...The Nekropolis is a  continued rock which is nearly flat, and covered with small bushes,  and stunted grass. The sepulchres are not visible, as they are all of  the υπογαια kind, or under ground. The τραπεζα, or cover, of each  tomb, consists of a large block of stone, about a foot in  thickness...The Piraean tombs are easily opened; and although they  are so much concealed by weeds and bushes as to be invisible, their  quantity facilitates their discovery. The development is performed by  first breaking the trapeza, or cover, with a large hammer, and then  overturning it with a stong pole, as a lever. The tombs are cut in the  rock, and their common depth is four or five feet. They are filled with a  fine loose earth, which has been a subsequent introduction, rather  than an original deposit. Some of these sepulchres in a state of  superior preservation were opened in my presence; and they  contained earth not more than a foot in depth. The first day I  empolyed ten men, who, in the course of nine hours, opened thirty in  a day.The common calculation is, that two men can open four in a  day...' Vol. I, p.431-432
The Guilford Puteal is engraved for the title page in Edward Dodwell, 'Alcuni Bassirilievi della Grecia' (Rome 1812), and mentioned in Edward Dodwell, 'A Classical and Topographical Tour through Greece, during the years 1801, 1805, and 1806', (London, 1819),Vol. 2, p.200-204: '...When I was at Corinth, I saw the marble peristomion, or mouth, of an ancient well [note 6: 'It is at present in London, in the collection of the Earl of Guildford [sic]. When I saw it at Corinth, it was still used as the mouth of a well; but it had evidently been removed from its original position, as it was turned the wrong side upwards, and, consequently, very difficult to draw; and, from the friction occasioned by those who drew water from it, the figures were much injured, and most of the heads destroyed. It belonged to the noble and ancient family of Notara, who are mentioned, by the Byzantine writers, as a powerful house, when the Palaeologi were emperors of the East. These mouths of wells, which were enriched with sculpture, were denominated putealia sigillata by the Romans. See Cicero ad Attic., b. 1. epist. 8'] , on the exterior of which were sculptured ten figures of divinities; and which, from the subject, had probably belonged to the temple of Apollo, being one of the sacred wells, which were used in sacrificial lustrations...The Corinthian well, which is of the Aeginitic, or archaic style, seems to allude to the reconciliation of Apollo and Hercules, who had been at variance on account of the tripod, which the latter had seized from Delphi...The figures are in very low relief, and partake of the dry rigidity of the earliest sculpture: their motions are stiff and unbending, and the folds of their vests formal and monotonous: there is, however, a certain nobleness of character, which impresses the beholder...'.",,Not on display,,,antiquities,,Associated with: Athens;  Associated with: Corinth,,,Purchased from: R Gilbertson,,,Previous owner/ex-collection: Edward Dodwell,1962,Officer's Reports 30 March 1962,,Greek and Roman,,"2012,5019.1.48",,,

Edward Dodwell, 'A Classical and Topographical Tour through Greece, during the years 1801, 1805, and 1806', (London, 1819), Vol. 2, p.254-255: 'Ligurio, which is a large village, is about five hours from Nauplia, and situated at the entrance grove of Aesculapius. It occupies the site of a small ancient city, which stood upon an oblong rock at the foot of some barren hills, part of the ancient Sapyselaton or Arachnaion [note 1: Pausan. b.2.c.25.], which were formerly decorated with the altars of Jupiter and Juno [note 2: Ibid]. The walls of the town are very much ruined; the parts which are still entire are in the third style. Many blocks and heaps are scattered about, but nothing approaching to a perfect building is left. Pausanians  [note 3: Loc. cit. χαμη. There is a village at present called Lessa between Epidauros and Methana.] mentions the village of Lessa, between Midea and Epidauros, and says that it contained the temple [note 4: ναος] of Minerva. Ligurio answers to the position of Lessa; but if it was surrounded by walls, it merited the name of πολις rather than that of χαμη.

'This plate exhibits a view of the interior of the Temple, after the exavation and the fallen fragments from the superstructure had been removed from the cella, and the portions of the frieze temporarily placed there. 
The combat of a Greek and a Centaur opposite was the first to reveal the series of remarkable sculptures which made the principal glory and reward of this fortunate labour. 
During our first visit of 1811, one of the travellers observed amongst the fallen ruins of massive stones occupying the cella, a narrow and tortuous descent sufficiently large to admit his head and shoulders, without, however, room to turn round. Into this he descended head foremost, while his companions held him by the legs, and secured his return, which might not otherwise have been easy. At the bottom he discovered a fox's nest - happily not then occupied - and on removing this the Greek and the Centaur appeared in all their energy.
Portions of the three orders employed in the interior of the metopes, the antefixes and the ceiling; are displayed as also are the attached columns of the cella. The position of the single column, the base of which was still in its place, the sacrarium, the posticum, the southern portico, and the landscape to the south, are seen beyond. The faithful dog; the rifle, and the portfolio, announce the artists as at no great distance.'

		'...After my return to Girgenti, I remained there till 14th November, applying  myself with close attention and infinite pleasure to attempting to reconstruct  the Temple of Jupiter Olympius. The examination of the stones and the  continual exercise of ingenuity kept me very busy, and at the end the  successful restoration of the temple gave me a pleasure which was only to be  surpassed by that of originally conceiving the design. 
		My days went by in great peace and content...In the last few days of my stay  my fame got about. The Caffe dei Nobili, the bishop and all, heard with  astonishment that I had unravelled the puzzle, and that all the morsels  composing the giants were still existing and could be put together again. A  dignitary of the Church, (Don ?) Candion Panettieri, sent me a message to  say that if I would mark the stones and give directions for the setting up of  one of the giants, he would undertake the expense of doing it. I was tempted  by this offer and the immediate notoriety it would give me, and agreed and  completed my sketch as far as it could be carried and took it to him. It was  copied immediately, and with my name appended as the author, sent to  Palermo. Then I went over the fragments with Raffaelle Politi and marked the  stones corresponding with the numbers in the design...'

The fragment decorated with the man playing the harp is engraved in Edward Dodwell, 'A Classical and Topographical Tour  through Greece, during the years 1801, 1805, and 1806', (London, 1819), opposite Vol I, p. 461. This fragment, the fragment with the ivy decoration, and the fragment with the women were found by Dodwell in a tomb:
 ‘Amonst the fragments which we selected from the tombs, some had a classical interest, from their tendency to elucidate or to confirm passages in ancient authors...another fragment of the most beautiful design, represents the naked figure of a man, bearded, and crowned with ivy, playing upon an heptachord, χελυς or tortoise harp. While he is using the plectrum with the right hand, he touches the strings with the left. He seems to be singing at the same time, which was practised in the earliest periods, as we see in Homer...The body of the χελυς, harp, was probably in the first instance manufactured from the shell of the tortoise; but is was sometimes made of wood, which resembed the form of the original…Another fragment is ornamented with the ivy plant, in relief, and gilt. This is the golden ivy, or hedera chrysocarpos of Pliny, and the hedera pallens of Virgil. It was a Dionysiac plant, and the vases which were ornamented with it were called hederata and corymbiata. On another fragment four females are observed, one of whom is carrying a large vase, while another holds the ladies' work-basket (καλθος), which was made with small sticks; these figures are dressed in the ξυστις, or short outer garment. I have mentioned this fragment, because I have seen a vase from the kingdom of Naples [belonging to Mr. Millingen], on which the same subject is represented with such perfect similitude, that they were evidently copied from the same original, which was probably some well-known painting or sculpture... ' Vol. 1, p. 459-461:        
'Near the port of Zea on the northern side of the Piraeus, are the  remains of walls and two round towers...These towers were separated by a gate which probably constituted the entrance to the great cemeter, or Nekropolis of the Piraeus, which extends a considerable way towards Mount Aigaleos, in a northern direction. At the northern extremity of the burying-ground is a low rocky hill covered with sepulchres, which are concealed by the soil and weeds; and where some broken sarcophagi are found...The Nekropolis is a continued rock which is nearly flat, and covered with small bushes, and stunted grass. The sepulchres are not visible, as they are all of the υπογαια kind, or under ground. The τραπεζα, or cover, of each tomb, consists of a large block of stone, about a foot in thickness...The Piraean tombs are easily opened; and although they are so much concealed by weeds and bushes as to be invisible, their quantity facilitates their discovery. The development is performed by first breaking the trapeza, or cover, with a large hammer, and then overturning it with a stong pole, as a lever. The tombs are cut in the rock, and their common depth is four or five feet. They are filled with a fine loose earth, which has been a subsequent introduction, rather than an original deposit. Some of these sepulchres in a state of superior preservation were opened in my presence; and they contained earth not more than a foot in depth. The first day I empolyed ten men, who, in the course of nine hours, opened thirty in a day.The common calculation is, that two men can open four in a day...'

Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin. Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from  Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example.

The god wears a cloak with clasp, and a tunic ending in a pleated skirt and boots (the uppers are not clear and the right ankle has a narrow band). The hair is in bands of curls, perhaps radiating from a lost chignon, and forms corkscrew points on the forehead from under a fillet; the long earrings have two or more stones. Part of one hand survives holding a double-handled drinking vessel resembling a 'kantharos', originally perhaps held in both hands. One leg with heel raised lies at a slant and both feet rest on the treasure pouring out as water from the pots below.
The goddess sits on the same level but the drapery on her left seems to rest on a higher surface; she wears a high-girt tunic and, from the left shoulder and very loosely, a long draped overgarment. The tunic, with its knotted fastening, slips from her right shoulder onto her upper arm. Her bare feet rest on the pot beneath her and on the water or treasure pouring from it. She has earrings like her consort's, a collar and bracelets. Her curled hairstyle resembles his but is knotted in the centre against a pointed tiara in front of a wreath; behind it rises a polos widening upwards and with a sawtooth band under a flat top. What may be a floral ornament or chignon on the side joins her head to a curving cornucopia, held in her left hand; its body has a vine-leaf enrichment, a horned animal head at the bottom and abundant fruit at the top. She stretches out a long-fingered right hand to rest just above her consort's lap and both arms have double bracelets.
Both sit on a throne with chair back, shouldered beside the goddess and with a turned leg below the god; they have almost identical sharp faces, staring open eyes, pointed and jutting chins and the lips appear parted. Between them a bearded old man with flowing chignon and a cloak tied to his back leans over the top of the seat, offering the god a small bag. A child with a short sleeveless cloak and anklets raises his head and reaches out for the goddess's right leg. On their right a dwarfish naked figure, with fangs pointing upward and clasping a pot, looks pathetically up; if the circular projection on his matted hair is the bottom of a spear or staff, there is no further evidence for it higher up the piece.

‘A small mutilated female figure.  The right breast is naked, the other parts are entirely covered with drapery.  It has a necklace, from which a scarabæus is suspended.  The lower part of the figure appears to have suffered from fire’ (Combe, manuscript note in his interleaved copy of the 1808 edition of the Synopsis, Department of Greece and Rome). Combe’s description served as the model for Ellis’s text, with the omission of the word ‘female’. Smith is surely correct in seeing the figure as male.
Bought from Byres in 1784 for 5 Scudi (TY 7/693), rendered by Townley as £1.3s. (TY 10/16).
In 1784 Townley compiled a list of ‘Articles to be sent from Mr Byres’ (TY 10/15), and on 18 August, Byres wrote from Rome enclosing a Bill of Lading. His letter (TY 7/693) included a list of the contents of the case, which was more extensive than Townley’s list. In addition to vases, terracottas, intaglios, and items in ivory and glass, there were nine items in marble or other stone, eight of which can be identified in the collection (among which 1805,0703.137; 1805,0703.113; 1805,0703.214; 1805,0703.66; 1805,0703.444). The ninth, ‘a large marble scarabeo about three inches diameter characters at the bottom’ (TY 10/15), described by Byres as ‘a Bagarozzi’, remains unidentified. It was charged by Byres at 4 Scudi (TY 7/693), rendered by Townley as 19s. (TY 10/16). Townley recorded the date of the transaction incorrectly as 1778 (TY 12/2), 1786 (TY 10/16), and other years as noted in the individual entries. The erroneous date of 1785 may be derived from Townley’s payment of the transport costs in April of that year (‘Union Catalogue’, fo. 75r).

Leg repaired and joined to 1905,0612.7, a marble figure of a male cat with head facing to the right. The legs have been repaired and the pinned tail is lost. Fine translucent (Parian?) marble with a greenish tinge probably from Paros.
Much of the body is covered with claw chisel marks, though there are no obvious traces of the marks left by the use of the running drill. There is a sharp definition between the stomach and the right leg. The underside of the cat, particularly around the genitals, is well finished. A hole in the stump of the tail shows where rest of tail was originally joined. There is no indication either of any support for the cat.
A fragment of a leg has been joined to the rear right leg (reg.no.1906.6-12.18).  The cat is in good condition except for the loss of all the lower legs and paws, the tail and small chips from both ears.  The paws have been restored in plaster, though the originals likely survive as separate joining base fragments (GR 1905.6-12.15, 16 & 17).
His rear right leg is outstretched, and the paw touching the ground gently, unlike the two legs which step forward where the paw is placed firmly on the ground, and therefore appears to be more elongated in plan.  This arrangement of the paws suit perfectly the walking movement of the cat.  If these paws do not belong to this particular cat, then they belong to one of a similar scale and style.  The bases and the cat both have a similar, unfinished appearance about them which suggests that they do indeed belong together and the marble type is identical.  The undersides of each plinth are roughly worked with a punch, perhaps in order that they should grip onto the base on which the sculpture was originally displayed.",,,,,,,Hellenistic,332BC - 200BC,Made in: Greece,Found/Acquired: Naukratis (?),marble,,,carved,Length: 7.50 centimetres,,"Part of a group of 20 cat sculpture fragments in marble and limestone, many in the same style and possibly the same sculptor (GR 1905,0612.1 - 20). These include a base with a dedication to Bubastis. All were purchased by Flinders Petrie, from a dealer in Cairo who gave it a Bubastis provenance. Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin. This appears to be confirmed by two marble cat sculptures in the same style, and possibly the same sculptor, in a group of artefacts from Naukratis acquired for Cairo Egyptian Museum from the nearby town of Damanhur (Edgar 1903, CG27518-9). Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Ismail Fahmy street, Kom el-Dika in Alexandria, excavated by Dr. Mohamed Abdel Maqsoud. The discovery was reported in 2010 and the figures studied by Mervat Seif el-Din. The sanctuary was founded by Queen Berenike, wife of King Ptolemy III Euergetes (246-222 BC), and dedicated to Bubastis/Bastet. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 an earlier find probably from this temple at Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were made, or at least finished, in Naukratis, or less likely Alexandria.
Cats are not commonly represented in Greek art, particularly sculpture (Richter 1930, 33-35; British Museum Vase E171, F126, F207, F308, GR1906.0710.9).

There is no indication that the two pieces actually belong together at all. The neck muscles suggest this should face forward, not to the side as reconstructed. The head is also too big for 1905,0612.4. The marbles of both head and bodies are the same, probably Pentelic, but the head has been exposed to fire at some point in its history, and this has given it a rather reddish hue.  It is, of course, possible that the head was burnt after it had been broken from the body, but it could equally well have belonged to a similar cat.  The scale of the head does appear a little large for the body to which it is attached, particularly when it is compared with the two cats that preserved their heads.  The head may belong with GR1905.6-12.5 which is slightly larger than GR1905.6-12.4, but certainly of the same marble as the head. When the head first arrived in the museum, it was registered under a separate number, and the entry states that it is cut flat behind, with an iron rivet in the middle.  
Possibly represents a leopard or large wild-cat, a lion is unlikely. The sculptor was probably intending to create a life-size cat in stone, but knowing the physiology of lions better created a mini-lion, or leonine cat (see also 1905,0612.4, 1905,0612.5 and Athens). 
Part of a group of 20 cat sculpture fragments in marble and limestone, many in the same style and possibly the same sculptor (GR 1905,0612.1 - 20). These include a base with a dedication to Bubastis. All were purchased by Flinders Petrie, from a dealer in Cairo who gave it a Bubastis provenance. Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin. This appears to be confirmed by two marble cat sculptures in the same style, and possibly the same sculptor, in a group of artefacts from Naukratis acquired for Cairo Egyptian Museum from the nearby town of Damanhur (Edgar 1903, CG27518-9). Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from  Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis,  or less likely Alexandria.

There is no example of a fish-selling figure in Cypriot art, though it is possible to interpret the figure as someone sacrificing fish - a rarely mentioned paractice in Greece but quite common in Egypt though not in depictions. Dating depends on physique-related parallels with nude kouroi like the Cnidian kouroi in Amsterdam and London B320 and the nude youths with bent right arm London B 441 and 442 which date to 590 BC - 570 BC, while the seated statue of Chares from Didyma is dated around 570/560 or slightly later.

Powerful with pronounced rib cage and muscles on shoulder and legs with thick tail. One forepaw on duck or goose. Red colouring on neck of bird and the cats left paw may have indicated blood. The head, tail, bottom of the back legs and rear part of base has broken off. Top and right side of paw is damaged. 
Unfinished rear of sculpture group.  The cat’s front right paw is not completely carved.  Instead, the junction between the cat’s body and this leg is marked with a shallow groove.  Similarly, the bird’s wing is only roughly carved, and its underside is only blocked out coarsely with a punch.  The body of the bird is treated in a similar cursory manner, with not even an attempt made by the sculptor to mark out its lower extremities: here the marble is left rough. There are areas of the front of the group that have not been finished in the round, for instance at the junction between the bird’s and cat’s body: the sculptor has left an area of coarsely chiselled marble.  Furthermore, there is a rough stump beneath the cat’s body at the front, and here the cat’s underside has not been properly modelled.  The genitals of the cat are also only roughly modelled.
Greek workmanship is evident in the tool mark remains. Running drill used to separate body from base and rump from tail. Most of the surface is covered with claw chisel marks. The bird eye is indicated by an unfinished drill hole. 
Parts of the bird have also been treated in a rather cursory manner, particularly in areas which would have been less visible.  The bird’s left eye is indicated by a shallow drill hole, unlike the more detailed carving of the right eye.  That the whole group was originally brightly painted is suggested by the remains of red pigment, probably indicating blood,  around the bird’s neck and under the cat’s protracted right claw where it grasps the bird’s wing.  The surface was not completely finished as there are claw chisel marks over much of the body. 
Traces of Egyptian blue paint on the beak of the bird, red on the paws and yellow paint on the rear right leg of the cat. The marble is a fine grained white marble with mica possibly Pentelic marble from the Penteliko Mountain near Athens. 
Missing: lower back legs and paws; all of the back half of the plinth; the neck and head and the tail; the top and right side of the right fore-paw are also slightly damaged.

These include a base with a dedication to Bubastis. All were purchased by Flinders Petrie, from a dealer in Cairo who gave it a Bubastis provenance. Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin. This appears to be confirmed by two marble cat sculptures in the same style, and possibly the same sculptor, in a group of artefacts from Naukratis acquired for Cairo Egyptian Museum from the nearby town of Damanhur (Edgar 1903, CG27518-9). Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from  Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis,  or less likely Alexandria.
1905,0612.4 and 1905,0612.5 were probably made by the same sculptor as both have the same carving style, subject  and pose: that of a powerful, muscular, alert cat in an active pose with similar rendering of detail, sharply cut groin and stretched back leg (unlike other cats that are more rounded and less powerful, relaxing). 1905,0612.5 is slightly larger and more muscled than 1905,0612.4, but animals were often offered as pairs and may have been intended as such.
The sculpture was probably intended to be seen from the front only, or at least in a position where it would be difficult to examine the back of the group carefully.  This is evident from the unfinished state of the rear of the group. Previously restored with the head GR1905.6-12.10.
The bird appears to be a representation of a goose. All the birds represented in the British Museum Naukratis cat sculpture group were covered with traces of Egyptian blue plaint. Geese in the Late Period were commonly sacrificed for Horus, son of Isis, representing the symbolic destruction of the enemy (Junker 1910, 69-79; Wildung 1977; Graindorge 1996, 89-91; Bouanich 2005, 151), as represented in contemporary third century BC depictions of Harpokrates (Horus) strangling a fox-goose (British Museum GR 1845,0705.1; Ridgway 2006: 645 fig. 1; Schollmeyer 2003; 2007). Geese were also sacrificed during the festival of Isis in Alexandria and Philadelphia (Dunand 1973, 76;  P. Cair. Zen. IV.59560; BGU VII.1501) and for the empress Arsinoe Philadelphos (P. Oxy. 27 2465; Schorn 2001, who was likened to Aphrodite and Isis).

V. Müller in Ath. Mitt., 1921, p. 44; Poulsen in Jahrbuch, 1906, p. 198, n. 151.; Nick 2006 attributes the figurine to Yon's type I F.; Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician’s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (AΠ 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts Φ3, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context ΦB).

Attributions to find-spots are based on (1) Alfred Biliotti’s diary kept  during excavations at Kamiros between November 1863 and June  1864, which records the contents of two votive deposits and over 300  graves; (2) entries in the Museum Register, often stipulating the find- spots of individual objects excavated by Biliotti; (3) the Kamiros tomb list, produced around the same time as his entries in the Museum  Register. It lists the contents of each grave and votive deposit, along  with their corresponding registration numbers; (4) the Kamiros index  cards, written by Donald Bailey in the 1960’s.

It might almost be mistaken for a piece of architectural moulding' (Petrie journal 1885, 202). This was found in context AΠ4 from the bothros of the sanctuary of Apollo, dated c.600BC-560BC. Published (Smith, no. 103;  Knackfuss in Milet, I, 2, p. 88/112; Mallet, Premiers Etablissements, p. 260, fig. 51; V. Müller in Ath. Mitt., 1919, p. 42; Poulsen in Jahrbuch, 1906, p. 198, n. 151). Nick (2006, 64) puts the figure in the context of Yon's type I C (Yon 1974).
Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician’s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (AΠ 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts Φ3, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context ΦB).

Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician’s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (AΠ 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts Φ3, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context ΦB).

Whether found in  houses or thrown out into the roads, I have never seen, as they have always been found by diggers not in my employment. ... of those found are ... a male figure the upper part of Hermes Kriophoros in limestone' (Petrie 1886, 36).
Kriophoros (ram- bearer) youths wearing a ‘short chiton’ or (perhaps more accurately described as) Egyptian apron and kilt (shendyt). All Naukratis examples unworked backs and it is uncertain from the fragments whether they were standing or striding figures. Kriophoros figures are commonly dated to the early 6th century BC (Petrie 1886,  36; Fourrier 1999, 562; Möller 2000, 157-158;  Nick 2006, 33-35, 107, no.  6,  pl. 3) and were dated 575-550BC on the basis of parallels from Samos, Lindos and Kamiros with a terminus ante quem  of 560/550 BC (Nick 2006, Type 1.3). Parallels from Lindos (Blinkenberg 1931, 1721-1733, 1734 and 1745), Kamiros (Jacopi 1933, 280), Samos (Schmidt 1968, C121, 122, 195, pl. 97), Amrit (Hermary 1989, 37, no. 31) and Cyprus (Cesnola 1885, Pl. 16, 22; Gjerstadt 1948, 319-20, fig. 44). These should now be dated to the period 620/600-575/560BC, on the basis of stratified parallels (Berges 2006, nos 55-6; Henke 2011; Henke 2013). Though likely produced in Cypriot, these seem to have been influenced by and made almost exclusively for export to East Greece (Höckmann 2009, 256).

It lists the contents of each grave and votive deposit, along  with their corresponding registration numbers; (4) the Kamiros index  cards, written by Donald Bailey in the 1960’s. These mainly record the contents of graves from the Fikellura cemetery and are organised  according to tomb group; (5) the Kamiros well list, which is based upon the Kamiros tomb list with additions by Reynold Higgins and Virginia Webb.

The figure matches a type very common in terracotta figures which was introduced and brought over from the Levant by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC. The instrument is only associated with women and Nick points out that it might well be associated with the goddess Aphrodite which would emphasise the importance of the findspot.
Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician’s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (AΠ 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts Φ3, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context ΦB).

Nick (2006, pp. 62-63) argues that the object the figure is holding in her right cannot be an ankh nor any other form of Egyptian amulet; similarly difficult appears to be the identification of the object as a Cypriot amulet.; Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F).

Kriophoros (ram- bearer) youths wearing a ‘short chiton’ or (perhaps more accurately described as) Egyptian apron and kilt (shendyt). All Naukratis examples unworked backs and it is uncertain from the fragments whether they were standing or striding figures. Kriophoros figures are commonly dated to the early 6th century BC (Petrie 1886,  36; Fourrier 1999, 562; Möller 2000, 157-158;  Nick 2006, 33-35, 107, no.  6,  pl. 3) and were dated 575-550BC on the basis of parallels from Samos, Lindos and Kamiros with a terminus ante quem  of 560/550 BC (Nick 2006, Type 1.3). Parallels from Lindos (Blinkenberg 1931, 1721-1733, 1734 and 1745), Kamiros (Jacopi 1933, 280), Samos (Schmidt 1968, C121, 122, 195, pl. 97), Amrit (Hermary 1989, 37, no. 31) and Cyprus (Cesnola 1885, Pl. 16, 22; Gjerstadt 1948, 319-20, fig. 44). These should now be dated to the period 620/600-575/560BC, on the basis of stratified parallels (Berges 2006, nos 55-6; Henke 2011; Henke 2013). Though likely produced in Cypriot, these seem to have been influenced by and made almost exclusively for export to East Greece (Höckmann 2009, 256).

The hair is very similarly treated on the statuette in Leipzig (Rumpf in Ant. Plastik, p. 218), which also shows the diadem, but in paint (Smith no. 114; Naukratis, I, pl. 1, fig. 5; Deonna, Apollons archaiques, no. 154. and pl. VII, no. 206).
Höckmann (2007, 183) states that the figure's original height must have been approximately 50 cm. There is no immeadiately comparable example available among the Cypro-Greek kouros statuettes from Naukratis or eastern Greece. The sharp linear separation of the facial features, the plastically rendered eyebrows and the thick strands of hair place it in a tradition of Cypriot works, particularly from Paphos. A fine modelling is visible on the face's surface. It might be possible that the head did not belong to a kouros but a cloaked youth. There is a close connection with the statue from Paphos. The slim face suggests a date close to that of the kouros from Moscow [Pushkin Museum I 1a.3000(3202)].","Sculpture / Catalogue of Greek Sculpture in the British Museum; Möller 2000 / Naukratis, Trade in Archaic Greece; Höckmann 2007 / Zyprisch-griechische Kleinplastik: Kouroi, andere Figuren und plastisch verzierte Gefässe; Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.

Spencer-Churchill, a noted collector of bronzes whose collection was dispersed after his death in 1964. The entry in his register (no. 218) states that it was: ‘Acquired in Rethymno where it was probably excavated’.  It is possible that it was originally deposited at a rural sanctuary in the Rethymnon area, but its findspot is unknown.
It was published by Sir Arthur Evans, excavator of Knossos, in the Journal of Hellenic Studies (see below). He dated it to the Late Minoan I period, around 1600 BC, and compared it to an ivory bull-leaper found at Knossos, now in Heraklion Museum. Without the accompanying bull, however, it is difficult to know if this is a close parallel: the bronze group is the only known complete sculpture of bull-leaping (with the possible exception of earlier zoomorphic clay vessels of cattle with human figurines clinging on to their horns). A number of bronze human figurines have been found at Minoan peak sanctuaries, and naturalistic bronze goat depictions from Ayia Triada: these provide comparable examples of bronzeworking from the Neopalatial period.
The group was exhibited in the 1936 exhibition of ‘British Archaeological Discoveries in Crete and Greece 1886-1936’ held at the Royal Academy to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the British School at Athens. It was again on display in 1946, at the Royal Academy exhibition of Greek Art, where the Sunday Graphic declared it to be ‘the loveliest thing to be seen in London this week’.
Much has been written about the practice of bull-leaping since Arthur Evans discussed the depictions he found at Knossos both in terms of Minoan religion (he thought that bull-leaping events were staged to honour the Minoan Goddess) and the practicalities of the event. Indeed Evans discusses bull-leaping both in terms of the later Thessalian ‘taurokathapsia’, Spanish bull-fighting  and modern-day rodeos. It has been argued that bull-leaping events took place in the central courts of Minoan palaces, but no convincing evidence has been found. More recently scholars, notably John Younger, have seen bull-leaping as part of a longer sequence of activities involving rounding up cattle, leaping, and possibly sacrifice. Another approach, including Nanno Marinatos’s work, has been to look at the potential symbolism of bull-leaping. Others have seen bull-leaping as an extension of the relationship between people and domestic cattle in Crete.

A limestone fragment in Oxford G1020 is very similar and was probably made in the same workshop. The proportions of the body, positioning of the arms and indication of the kneecap suggest that this figure is contemporary with the figures of the Cnidos group Marmaris Museum 11.8.99 and BM 1864.10-7.315 . A wig-like hairstyle is probably to be understood.
'These are found in almost the oldest stratum of the town, principally along the middle of the eastern side. Whether found in  houses or thrown out into the roads, I have never seen, as
they have always been found by diggers not in my employment. Several of those found are
shown in pi. i.' (Petrie 1886, 36). This corrects: Höckmann (2007, 177) who argues that due to the fact that it was found in 1884, it is likely that it comes from the Apollo temenos.
The material has previously been identified as sandstone.
Rough, but early work; the naturalism of the abdomen suggests Egyptian handiwork. Though the proportions are thicker, the general profile is very similar to Sculpture B438, and this statuette may be a rough copy of the same type.

The leopard skin is part of the ceremonial wear of Egyptian priests, Sem-priests especially, though for this figurine the way the leopard skin is draped is more typical for priests of Amun. The figure thus most likely represents a priest of Amun.
Pryce in the British Museum Sculpture Catalogue had proposed the figure to be a Naucratite copy of a Cypriote type of about mid-sixth century B.C., suggesting that the artist  misunderstood the drapery of his model, which should have consisted of Ionic chiton and mantle, but actually omits the chiton, save the left sleeve, which is combined into the mantle. On the other hand, the conventional Cypriote smoothness is considered well reproduced. The question of the production place of the gypsum figurines from Naukratis remains debated, though current opinion tends to favour Cyprus; cf. esp. Jenkins 2001.
The figures bears its ID number and Smith's number 111, the latter of them being in a faint red and might easily be confused with traces of paint.

Parallels in representation of the legs and knees can be found in the kouroi from the Tenea-Volomandra and Melos groups, the face bears resemblance with a head from Didyma and a statuette from Idalion. The type of chiton represented finds parallels in a limestone statuette from Potamia and a figure from Kazaphani.  The stone left between the legs is a typical feature of Egyptian stone statues. The topic of the hunter is unusual in Cypriot art, however, the Cypriot Herakles bears some elements found in this statue; the theme of hunting hares is not uncommon in Egyptian depictions. Certain clothing elements, like the cap and the belt, place it in a Cypriot context.

This group begins to appear in 560/550 BC at the latest, as finds from Lindos and Samos prove, and it is surely influenced by the drapery of the Greek Kore. The closed position of the naked feet of this figure and London B453 (Nick 2006, cat.40) place them in Yon’s category I F. Gardner, 1888. p. 57, pl. XIV.4
Nick, 2006. Cat. 39, p. 118-119, pl. 18; pp.59-64; Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician’s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (AΠ 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts Φ3, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context ΦB).

The motif of the kourophoros is taken from the Egyptian tradition of Isis-Hathor nursing Horus (Nick 2006, p. 68). However, the theme has been known in Cyprus since the Bronze Age and the depiction in limestone is rare (only known from two examples). The version of the baby stretching out its arms is apparently unknown in Cypriot though not unusual in Greek art. The interpretation of the group has often been debated; despite the lack of attributes this figure is understood as a goddess and its dedication in the sanctuary of Aphrodite fits in with this idea.

Nick (2006, 46-51) argues that the figure fits in with a group of kouroi - the Golenischeff-Kouros in Moscow, London B 443 and B 446 from Naukratis, Boston 88.734 and Cairo 27425 - due to the treatment of the body despite certain differing features. They are probably from the same workshop, though this figure shows fairly strong similarities with Cypriot limestone figures.

Standing nude youth. Both lower legs are missing from the knee and are now
restored in plaster; the statuette is broken obliquely across the neck and across the thighs and rejoined with slight restorations, including the right forearm and parts of the front surface of the neck and of both thighs.
The figure is standing in a frontal position, balanced on both legs, the left advanced, the right drawn back. The arms hang stiffly at the sides, the fingers closed and grasping short rods after the Egyptian convention, with thumbs pointing downwards. At the back the hands are unworked. Only the upper arms are detached from the body.
A thick cord, like a diadem, is running across the forehead from ear to ear; above it, the hair is parted in the centre back to the crown and swept back behind, to fall in front of each shoulder in four straight tresses and down the back in eleven, three tresses are falling down onto the shoulders on either side. The whole of the hair is cut up by grooves into oblong patches; the vertical grooving is more regular than the horizontal. 
The head is high and rounded; it is separated from the body by means of a fine incised line around the neck. The face is long and tapering, with a pointed chin. The ears are large, with swollen lobes. The eyes are large with protruding eyeballs and the lower lid almost horizontal; the outer angle is prolonged; the eyebrows are incised lines. The nose, which is partly broken away, is long and wide at the base. The mouth is small, with fairly straight lips, the upper slightly projecting and the corners indicating a smile; there are deep hollows under the corners. The cheeks are flat and fleeing towards the back; the chin is protruding.
The body is long and narrow, with sloping rounded shoulders, and very high breasts and waist. The breast shows an arrowhead pectoral groove underneath; the nipples and also the navel are indicated by incised circles. The stomach and the pubic area are protruding. The section is generally narrow; the back is a flattened plane with spinal groove and a small buttocks. The upper arms are very short; the elbows placed high and marked by an arrowhead groove; the thumbnails are indicated. The thighs are long and rather sturdy as well as slightly ridged, and they are not separated until just above the knees; the kneecap is indicated by a grooved lozenge. Neither arms not legs show muscles.
The whole was originally covered with reddish-brown paint, which remains largely on face and shoulders and in traces elsewhere. There is a touch of vermilion on the lips and hairband and black traces are remaining on the hair, around the eyes and on the left eyebrow; black shadows indicate a beard on the upper lip as well as pubic hair.",,,,,,,Cypro-Archaic II,580BC - 570BC,Made in: Cyprus,Excavated/Findspot: Sanctuary of Aphrodite (Naukratis),alabaster,,type series: Höckmann Type 1 (Sub group 3),painted,Height: 257 millimetres; Weight: 826 grammes; Width: 88 millimetres; Depth: 44 millimetres,,"'The earliest of the Naucratite Apollos; the main characteristics of profile and modelling are reproduced in more advanced forms in Sculptures B441-2; the type is then to be attributed to some school, and the long face, thin section and bony structure recall the West Ionic types of the islands (cf.

Höckmann (2007,. N9, pp.176-177; pl. 8-9, 38a BM GR 1888,1006.1) states that according to Smith and Deonna the figure was  found in the temenos of Apollo. However, Smith does not state this, it is interpreted as an 'Apollo'.  Whilst this was acquired from Petrie, who excavated the Temple of Apollo, it was acquired after the second season, when Petrie assisted Gardner in the excavation and planning of the temple of Aphrodite, where the majority of Alabaster figures with recorded context were found.
The piece was reconstructed from 3 parts. Each of these parts had the original context recorded with a Φ and a number in faint pencil. The head and chest came from Φ 8, the torso Φ (no number visible as it has been overwritten with the registration number) and the legs Φ 9 . These context numbers are consistent with only those issued to objects excavated from the Sanctuary of Aphrodite in the 1885-1886 season, not the Sanctuary of Apollo.","Sculpture / Catalogue of Greek Sculpture in the British Museum; Höckmann 2007 / Zyprisch-griechische Kleinplastik: Kouroi, andere Figuren und plastisch verzierte Gefässe; Möller 2000 / Naukratis, Trade in Archaic Greece; Jenkins 2001 / Archaic Kouroi in Naucratis: The Case for Cypriot Origin; Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (Phase 3)",On display (G69/dc30),"Exhibited:

The rendering of torso, shoulders and thighs is plump and exhibits a lack of interest in an anatomically correct rendering of the body. The straight line of the back and the backside of the thighs can also be found on the kouroi Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.1098 and Cairo, Egyptian Museum 27426; Cypriot works present us with the most prominent examples (e.g. Ergüleç 1972, pl.17.2b). Even though worked by a different hand, this figure can be assumed to be from the same workshop as British Museum 1888.0601.14 (B 442). The relatively early dating is based on stylistic features such as the broad shoulders, the arms being drawn-in towards the torso, the slender proportions and the wig-like hairstyle.

Traces of black and yellow paint on the lion's body, of yellow on the ears. Traces of black eye line and eye brow, and possibly left side of moustache. The figure's hair is a flat surface, parted in the centre and falling on the back with a straight edge. The features are worn; the face oval, the eyes slightly oblique, the mouth indicating a smile with the corners turned downwards. The earlobes are particularly large. The body is schematised with wide sloping shoulders and a slim waist. The arm is sturdy and mostly separated from the body. There are no indications of musculature or bone structure on the upper body. The base of the neck is sharp-edged and emphasised by the red band. The feet are almost parallel with the left slightly advanced; between the feet the stone has not been entirely removed. The upper half of the back is fairly flat; legs and buttocks are shown in the round; the heels are left as a vertical lump of stone.
The right hand is holding the lion's right hind leg; it is unclear what the left hand was holding, possibly the animal's tail. The lion hangs down vertically with the head facing to the viewer's left, eyes carved in high relief, the tongue protruding. Its paws are placed just above the man's own feet; the paws of the animal and the fingers and toes of the man are schematised.",,,,,,,Cypro-Archaic II,600BC-560BC,Made in: Cyprus (?),Excavated/Findspot: Sanctuary of Aphrodite (Naukratis),limestone,,type series: Nick Type 1.5,painted,Height: 21.30 centimetres; Length: 4.20 centimetres; Weight: 569 grammes; Width: 6.40 centimetres,,"Dated by Smith to 550BC, who describes it as a god or hero (Smith, no. 124;  Naukratis, II, pl. 14, fig. 10; Deonna, Apollons archaiques, p. 297; Mallet, Premiers Etablissements, p. 256, fig. 45; Poulsen in Jahrbuch, 1906, p. 205, n. 191).

The style of the garment and its lack of folds is a typical feature of the first quarter of the sixth century BC. The fringed border of the garment also occurs on figures from Lindos and one from Miletus which can be dated to before 560/550 BC due to their context. This statuette finds parallels in two examples from Idalion which are both dated to the seventh century; the figure is wearing - according to the Cypriot scheme -  a chiton, a himation, and a Cypriot cap and has its left arm bent like British Museum C49 from Idalion. The proportions resemble closely those of British Museum C48 from Idalion which would suggest a date in the late seventh century, though this was previously dated c. 590BC-580BC (Petrie 1886, pl. 2.1; Nick 2006, 23-28, 105, no 1, pl.1; Möller 2000, 158).",Nick 2006 / Zypro-ionische Kleinplastik aus Kalkstein und Alabaster; Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (Phase 3),Not on display,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,External,,,Miscellaneous number: UC16470 (Accession Number),,

The ‘cuvette Courteille’, probably designed by Jean-Claude Duplessis père (employed 1745/8-74),(1) first produced in this (the largest) size in 1753, takes its name from the Intendant des Finances, Jacques Dominique de Barberi, Marquis de Courteille (1696-1767), the King's representative in the factory's finance and administration from 1751-67.(2) The second and third sizes were not devised until July 1759.(3) The presence of three or four minor firecracks attests to the difficulty of firing this piece. The holes in the base appear to have been drilled after the piece was glazed and fired. Surviving examples in the Wallace Collection, London, are fitted with porcelain bulb holders but these may not be original.(4)
The same unidentified incised mark ‘IP’ appears on a vase of the same shape of the second size dated 1772 in the Wallace Collection.(5)
The scene on this example is copied faithfully as to the colours but in reverse from a painting by Francois-Herbert Drouais (1727-75) entitled ‘The Comte and Chevalier de Choiseul as Savoyards’ signed and dated 1758, now in the Frick Collection, New York.(6) This painting, exhibited in the ‘Salon’ of 1759, was engraved by La Live de Jully, and was initially in the possession of the Choiseul family, although the Frick Collection catalogue does not specify whether it belonged to the duc de Choiseul, Louis XV's foreign minister, or to another member of the family. The two boys depicted are (standing): Marie-Gabriel-Florent-Auguste, comte de Choiseul-Beaupré later Choiseul-Gouffier (1752-1817) and his brother Michel-Felix-Victor, chevalier and later comte de Choiseul-Daillecourt (1754-1815).(7)
The issue of the presumed Russian provenance of this piece, backed up by the half-effaced red number painted on the base which corresponds to inventory numbers on pieces still in the Hermitage Museum and which was the inventory mark of the Chief Chamberlain's Section at the Winter Palace, has not been satisfactorily explained. The piece has not been traced in the records of the State Hermitage Museum,(8) nor has it been noted in any of the catalogues of the sales of pieces from the Hermitage Museum held in Berlin in the late 1920s and early 1930s. However, the elder of the two boys, who took the title of Choiseul-Gouffier on his marriage to Adélaïde de Gouffier d'Ailly in 1777, fled to Russia in 1793. He spent some nine years there before returning to France in 1802. He was appointed by Tsar Paul I (175 4-1801) as director of the Russian Academy of Arts, as well as of all the Imperial libraries.(9) It is just possible that it was through him that the ‘cuvette’ came to be in Russia. Choiseul-Gouffier in fact left Russia somewhat suddenly when he fell out of the succeeding Tsar's(10) favour, according to his daughter-in-law. He had a distinguished career as a diplomat and archaeologist. His portrait was painted by Louis-Léopold Boilly (1761-1845) and engraved by Claude-Marie-François Dien (1787-1865).(11) Classical antiquities from his collection have found their way not only into the Louvre Museum but also into the British Museum.(12)
The iconography of the painting on this ‘cuvette’ has been discussed by Edgar Munhall(13) who has identified the equipment as a hurdy-gurdy (on the back of the standing figure), a ‘boîte à curiosité’ or peepshow (to the lens of which the seated figure is pointing), and a box for a marmot or the equipment of a ‘décrotteur’ beneath the seated figure. As Munhall remarks,(14) “their dog recalls the perennially faithful companion of wandering urchins, and the rough stony background . . . suggests the rigours of a wanderer's life. However, the boys' delicate features and pale complexions contrast with a real Savoyard's 'visage barbouillé de suie', and while the pattern of their clothing is correct, the materials are silk velvets”.
Few pieces of Sèvres porcelain painted with armorials are known (see reg. nos. 1948,1203.18 and Franks.391), nor are many porcelains painted as accurately after surviving paintings as this one. Although the scene is in reverse from the painting, it is difficult to imagine that Dodin could have worked entirely from an engraving, but must have seen the painting to achieve such a remarkably close match of the colours.
It has not been possible to discover who the original owner of the ‘cuvette’ was, as it remains unidentified in the factory sales records. The boys' father having died ten years before the piece was made, it is uncertain which member of the extensive Choiseul family might have purchased the piece, which may well have been a special order. As the painters' records for this period have not survived, the ‘cuvette’ cannot be traced by this route.

(7) The boys were the sons of Marie-Gabriel-Florent-Auguste de Choiseul called the comte de Choiseul-Beaupré (1728-53) of the Daillecourt branch of the Choiseul family, and his wife Marie-Françoise Lallemont de Betz, who were married on 10 February 1747.

(9) The author is grateful to Dr R. d'O. Butler for his comments on Choiseul-Gouffier's career. Monsieur J.-D. Augarde kindly provided the information through the present duc de Praslin that a copy of the sale catalogue of the comte de Choiseul-Gouffier at the ‘hôtel’ Marboeuf, Paris, 20 July (or perhaps 17 August as the printed date has been altered in ink) 1818 is kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum Library, London. Choiseul-Gouffier was a noted collector of Egyptian, Greek (he visited Greece in 1776), Roman and Celtic antiquities and, although the catalogue contains only part of his collection, it includes no porcelain except for two large Chinese dishes. Details of his life and work are given in ‘Nouvelle Biographic Générale’, published by Firmin Didot, Paris, 1856, Vol. X, and Baron Bon Joseph Dacier, Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de M. le comte de Choiseul-Gouffier in ‘Mémoire de l'Acade'mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres’, 23 July 1819, published Paris, 1819, and see Duc de Praslin, ‘Les Choiseul et l'histoire’, Paris, 1988, pp. 15 3-60. In 1798 Choiseul-Gouffier sent a note to Jacques Necker in which he claimed that he was familiar with porcelain-making, offered to reform the royal factory so that it would no longer need subsidy and act as director without salary, Archives nationales, F12, 1493, quoted Chavagnac, comte Xavier de and Grollier, marquis de, ‘Histoire des manufactures françaises de porcelaine’, Paris, 1906, p. 194.

1. On the shoulder: Heracles strangling the Nemean lion: the conception in the usual style for the scene; Heracles is nude. Suspended above are his bow, quiver, sword, club, and two garments. On the left is Athene to right, with long hair, high-crested helmet, aegis with scales and snakes, long embroidered chiton, spear and shield with three pellets. Behind her is Hermes to right, bearded, with petasos, short chiton and chlamys, both embroidered, endromides, and wand in right hand. On the right is Iolaos to left, bearded, in short chiton, with sword and club.
2. On the body: Harnessing of horses to a quadriga: A quadriga to right, into which a bearded warrior is stepping, with goad in right hand and reins in both; he has cuirass, short embroidered chiton, greaves, and Boeotian shield at back with three pellets as device. Two of the horses are already harnessed, and the charioteer, bearded, in long white chiton with folds shown by wavy lines, and petasos, is adjusting the fastenings; by his side is a dog to right. A third horse, probably the παράσειρος (horse harnessed loosely to another), is behind him, about to be harnessed; the fourth horse on the near side is omitted. By the further side of the chariot is an archer to right, bearded, with long hair, peaked cap, and embroidered jerkin and trousers. At the horses' heads is a warrior to left with high-crested helmet, greaves, two spears, and shield with device of a snake.

(1) Two Heroes (possibly Achilles and Ajax) casting lots before the statue of Athene. In the centre Athene stands to right, but looking to left, with right hand holding a spear obliquely across her breast, and left holding up her helmet: her hair is apparently in crobylos form (badly drawn), and she wears ear-rings, necklace, aegis with scale pattern and a fringe of conventionalised tabs, and a long tight-fitting sleeved chiton, decorated with crosses and trefoils. In the background behind her is a base, of rectangular form, cut by two horizontal lines: on each side is a bearded hero seated on a square base, leaning forward with left resting on two spears, and extending right as if to throw the dice (not indicated): their dress is indistinctly rendered, but it seems to consist of a short chiton, a loin cloth, parameridia, and greaves, both decorated with spirals: the one on right has a heavy sword hanging by a cross-belt. Behind each is his shield (seen in foreshortening) resting against the border, with high-crested helmet resting upon it: the device on right is a bull's head, on left a tripod: the helmet on left has both sides of the crest shown heraldically.
(2) Charioteer setting out. On each side a youth in an himation is seated on an ocladias, holding upright in his right a staff: between them stands to right a quadriga, into which a youth dressed in the charioteer's long chiton steps, holding in each hand a pair of reins, and in his left also a goad.
Severe style. The main design (1) occupies the entire body between the side handles: 2 occupies the same width on the shoulder of the vase. Brown edging of hair, inner markings (very little used) and necklace of Athene. Eye archaic; beards short and without edging: the hair is somewhat feebly treated. Below 1 a strip of linked lotus-buds: on each side, ivy;
above, key pattern: on each side of 2, net pattern; above, tongue. Below 1 the body is encircled with two thin purple lines, and a third surmounting the band of black rays on base of body: the side knobs of the vertical handle are painted purple.

Perseus looking on at the chaining of Andromeda. In the centre of the scene Andromeda stands en face, a tall slim figure in kidaris and shoes, a jacket and anaxyrides decorated with small brown circles, and a short bordered chiton with a vertical stripe of pattern and a black girdle. Her arms are firmly held by an Ethiopian youth on either side, over whose shoulders they pass: each of these wears a fillet, and a short bordered chiton with a broad brown girdle. They stand en face, but look at each other. On the right is a group of two Ethiopians making a hole in the raised ground for the erection of two posts to which Andromeda is to be fastened. One on the left stoops forward to right, lifting upright with both hands a thick stake, which he drives vertically into the ground: the other, kneeling on hands and knees to the left, delves in the ground with his right arm half buried in a hole: by the side of the hole lies a heap of earth which he has extracted: each figure wears a short tied bordered chiton, and a fillet: the chiton on the left has a broad black vertical stripe: the other has two horizontal zigzag lines in brown. Their movements are directed by a third Ethiopian, an old man with wrinkled forehead and short fringed chiton, who stands en face, holding the second stake upright in his left hand: he looks to left, pointing with his right forefinger to the hole, as if giving directions to the others. Next on the right is Kepheus, a bearded figure in a long chiton, mantle, kidaris, and shoes, who sits on a rocky elevation looking on, and leaning forward with both hands resting on the point of a knotted staff and his forehead resting on them, in an attitude of dejection. Last on the right is Perseus, who seems to have arrived unobserved, and who stands en face looking on and striking his forehead with his right palm in despair: he is a beardless youth, with wavy hair falling to his shoulders, and has a chlamys, the winged petasos (of the archaic form) fastened by a cord under his chin, high boots with ties at the top, and two spears held upright in his left hand. On the left of Andromeda three Ethiopians stand, holding preparations for a toilet. The one on the right looks at her, holding up on his left arm a square box, in his right an alabastron hanging by a cord. The next one looks to the left, holding in his right a mirror, in his left a pyxis with cover, and on his left arm a bordered mantle hangs: like the last, he stands en face, but looks to left towards the third who advances, carrying on his head a diphros with a striped cushion, holding the leg in his left, and with his right holding out a taenia decorated with key pattern. All these three have a fillet, and a short chiton, decorated above the waist with horizontal pairs of wavy lines and dots, and below it with pairs of vertical lines: the one on the left has a fringe at the lower edge. All the chitons, except those of the last three Ethiopians, have a row of dots around the armholes and neck: that of the old Ethiopian has a pattern of zigzags instead of dots.
Fine period. Purple fillets, cord, ground-lines, and sand. Brown for various decorations of dresses and inner markings. Eye in profile. Kepheus and Andromeda are of the usual Greek type. The design occupies a broad frieze, covering the entire shoulder of the vase: below it is a broad band of pattern, divided by the side handles: the front band is composed of a strip of alternate palmette and honeysuckle, laid on a strip of the same inverted: at the back is a similar strip, but more conventionalised. Around the neck, a single band of the same pattern: and round the lip and the insertion of each handle, egg pattern.",,,,,,,Attic,440BC (circa),Made in: Attica (Greece),Excavated/Findspot: Vulci,pottery,Red Figure,,painted,Height: 45.72 centimetres,,"For a discussion of this scene in the context of Attic depictions of racial difference, see Bérard 2000, 402-6 and fig. 5.11.

INTERIOR: man leading a woman (Odysseus and Briseis?). On the left a young woman, head lowered, is being led to the right. She wears a chiton and a himation (horizontal battlement border, dilute glaze vertical band, rows of dilute glaze dots) which is pulled up over the back of her head. She has a disc earring and a stephane with a row of sigmas. Her hair has a wash of dilute glaze and one long curly tress falls down behind her ear. Her mouth is slightly open and she must be exchanging words with the bearded man on the right, who similarly has his mouth open. Dressed in short chiton (dilute glaze folds), himation (rows of dots; battlement upper border) and petasos with red ties, he moves to the right, but turns his head back to look at the girl whom he leads, gripping her left wrist and hand in his right. He holds a spear in his left hand across his body, so that the point is above her head. There is dilute shading on his petasos at the top and above the beginning of the brim. His hair and beard are done with a dilute glaze wash and there are rows of dilute glaze dots on his neck. Border: stopt maeander (five-stroke, anticlockwise).
EXTERIOR:  the Arms of Achilles. 
Side A (upper): quarrel over the arms of Achilles. On the far left a male in dotted chlamys holds the right arm of the figure in front of him (his head and part of his draped lower torso are missing). In front is a bearded man, probably Ajax, in boots (dilute glaze wash) with horizontal rolls and red ties and a dotted himation with a black border loosely draped over his arms, who attempts to move forward to the right. He holds a sword back in his right hand and a striped scabbard in his left. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair. A youth tries to push him back to the left. He has a chlamys with rows of dots in dilute glaze over his upper arms and turns his head back to the right. His hair is painted with dilute glaze. In the centre is a man in a long chiton (folds in dilute glaze) and a dotted himation with a battlement upper border; he is presumably Agamemnon. He moves to the left, but his arms are outstretched to left and right; his head, which is missing, was turned to the right, as the red ties from his headband on the left indicate. On the right a youth pushes to the right at a bearded man. The youth has a himation (black border, rows of dots) loosely draped over his shoulders; his hair is combed up in plait over his neck and he has a double red hair-band. The bearded man, probably Odysseus, in front of him endeavours to move to the left. In the struggle his himation (black border, rows of dots) has slipped from his right shoulder; he has just drawn his sword from its striped scabbard, which he holds in his left hand (hand and top of scabbard missing). He wears boots like those worn by Ajax: rolls above the ankles, red ties and dilute wash. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair and his lips are slightly parted. On the far right a bearded man moves to the left, a dotted himation (black border) over his shoulders, his right hand gripping the left shoulder of the man in front, his left hand probably the man's left wrist (both missing). His hair is combed up into a stiff fringe and his pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair.
Side Β (lower): the vote for the arms of Achilles. On the far left stands Odysseus, dressed in a dotted himation with a battlement border (all the himatia on this side have such a border) and shoes. He leans on a knotty stick, his right hand on his hip under the drapery, his left hand up in front of his chest. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair. His mouth is open and he has a red apicate fillet. In front of him stands a youth, dressed in a himation with rows of dots and leaning on a knotty stick. He reaches down to the right with his right hand to place his pebble (not shown) on the plain block (dilute wash) in the centre. His hair is tied up in a plait over his neck and he has a double red fillet. His left hand is to be thought of as on top of his stick, near his right armpit. In front of him stands Athena who wears a chiton, himation, scaly snake-fringed aegis (dilute wash inside) and Attic helmet (dilute wash for caul; black neck-guard). She holds a spear upright in her right hand and gestures with her left hand. Her head (hair done with dilute wash) is turned to the right, but her right knee is bent and the leg is to be thought of as facing to the left. Her lower legs are obscured by the corner of the block. On the corner in front of the folds of her chiton are two rows of black pebbles, totalling twenty. In the centre stands a bearded man to the left, wearing a dotted himation and a red fillet. He twists his right shoulder in order to place a pebble (not shown) on the block which hides his lower legs. His left hand is on a knotty stick, which goes under his left armpit (lower part of stick not drawn). At the right corner of the block stands a youth in a himation with rows of dots and double red hair-band leaning back on a knotty stick. He also holds his right hand down to cast his vote. On the corner of the block in front of the folds of his himation are two rows of black pebbles, totalling eleven. On the right a bearded man in a dotted himation and shoes moves forward to the left to vote, but turns his head back to the right. He holds a knotty stick in his left hand across his body and holds his right hand out to vote (pebble not shown). He has a reserved head-band. On the far right stands Ajax, his dotted himation with its battlement border framing his head. He leans on a knotty stick (with groups of horizontal lines in dilute glaze on it), his head lowered in despair, his right hand to his forehead. He wears a red fillet.
Under handles: B/A, Corinthian helmet (dilute glaze on cheek-piece; black on neck-piece; dilute glaze wash for fur frontiet; chequer-board pattern on caul) on top of a shield (dilute glaze hatching before rim); A/B, pair of greaves (dilute glaze wash, elaborate modelling around knee-caps and a scroll on the calf, red ties above).

Attributed to Brygos by Klein, who was followed by Hartwig and others. Beazley gave it to his Brygos Painter. It is an early mature work of the artist and may be compared with the Louvre Troilos cup and the Vatican arming cup (ARV2 369, 3; 373, 48). These seem to be slightly later than Vase E68 and they lead on to fully mature works such as the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171). There is both vitality and power in the drawing and a fine range of moods in the narrative. Bloesch has attributed the potting to Brygos.
The quarrel between Ajax and Odysseus for the arms of Achilles has been discussed recently by O. Touchefeu in LIMC i sv Aias I  p. 324-7; D. Williams, AntK 23 (1980) 137-45; Schefold Sagen 259-61. See also H.A. Shapiro, BABesch 56 (1981) 149-50; G.F. Pinney and R. Hamilton, AJA 86 (1982) 581-4; and M. Tiverios, Mia ""Krisis ton Oplon"" tou zographou tou Sulea (Athens 1985); but contrast D. Williams in F. Lissarrague and F. Thelamon (eds.), Image et céramique grecque (Rouen 1983) 139 f.n. 60. For a possible early representation of the quarrel see A.-N. Malagardis in Ancient Greek and Related Pottery, Copenhagen 390-406. See also now Beazley in Beazley Lectures 91-2 and Robertson Art of Vase-painting 87-9.
Various suggestions have been offered as to the identity of the two figures on the interior: see ARV2 369, 2; Robertson HGA 232; D. Williams, AntK 23 (1980) 140; Schefold Sagen 261; Robertson Art of Vasepainting 95-6. The petasos worn by the man recommends an identification as Odysseus; the girl might be Chryseis, as D.S. Robertson suggested following Iliad i 439-45 (quoted in ARV2 369, 2), but this would remove any close connection with the scenes on the exterior. Martin Robertson (HGA 232) suggested Tekmessa with either Teukros leading her away after the death of Ajax or Ajax himself with his newly won concubine. Schefold, however, has recently suggested Briseis, an additional prize that went to Odysseus with Achilles' arms. The pair seem to be conversing and the angle of the spear recalls that held by Patroklos on the Getty Iliupersis cup by Onesimos (D. Williams, Getty Vases 5 [1991] 58): it surely symbolises possession. As a result, Schefold's solution is perhaps the best. A very similar pair, only the man lacks the petasos, occurs on a fine cup by the Foundry Painter in Tarquinia (ARV2 405, 1), which Beazley identified as Agamemnon and Briseis.
For the chequer board pattern on the caul of the helmet cf. the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171) and see Beazley in C.B. iii, 36, where he suggests that on such helmets a patterned fabric might have been attached to the metal, although it now seems more likely that the bronze was actually painted (cf. H. Bron in M. True and J. Podany [eds.], Small Bronze Sculpture from the Ancient World [Malibu 1990] 189-94). The horizontal bands on the boots worn by Ajax and Odysseus on side A are probably caused by tying additional thongs around the soft boots to try to stop them sliding down: cf. Morrow Greek Footwear 65: she notes the same effect on the Parthenon Frieze, North XXXIX 122 (her pl. 45).","Vase / Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 17, British Museum 9; Old Catalogue / A Catalogue of the Greek and Etruscan Vases in the British Museum",On display (G15/dc1),"Exhibited:

INTERIOR: man listening to a youth playing pipes. On the left sits a bearded man on a plain stool. He leans back, nonchalantly gripping his left knee with both his hands so that his foot is off the ground. A plain stick rests between his legs and a himation with a black border is casually draped over his thighs. He has a long thick red fillet around his head with a large loop at the back and triple tassels. His mouth is open and he may be supposed to be singing. On the right stands a youth playing the pipes (relief line indicates puffed cheeks). He is supported by a knotty stick under his left armpit. A himation with a black border is loosely draped over his right shoulder, round his back and is tucked up on top of the crook of the stick. He wears a pair of high boots and also has a long thick red fillet with loop and tassels in his hair. Above and behind the pair a food basket (partly missing) is hung from red ties.
Border: dotted saltire squares alternating with three units of stopt maeander (anticlockwise, mostly five-stroke).
EXTERIOR:  komasts and women.
Side A (upper): three males, a woman and a door. On the far left is hung a spotted flute-case. In front of it stands a youth playing the pipes. His weight is carried on his right foot, his left rests behind it, the toes curled over so that their tops touch the ground. He wears a himation (black border) loosely draped over his arms and has a red wreath in his hair. In front of him hangs a food basket with red ties above and tassels below. Next is a male to the right: the whole of the upper part of this figure is missing. He wears a himation (black border) and leans heavily on a knotty stick; his right leg is frontal. In front of him is a doorway with one leaf open (dilute strokes for the grain of the wood; black discs for the metal studs). Beyond the doorway is a couple shown making love. On the left are the slightly bent lower legs of a man, who wears a himation (black border) which falls loosely behind his legs. He was probably about to penetrate (perhaps anally) the naked hetaira, who bends forward, supporting herself with the aid of a knotty stick that she grips in her left hand and bracing herself with the right hand on her right knee, her left elbow on her left thigh. Her hair is cut short, she has a red wreath in her hair and she wears a disc earring. The small rounded object against her thigh near her bottom seems to be a drapery weight.
Ground line: two closely set reserved lines.
Side Β (lower) : two men, a woman and a youth. On the left a man playing the pipes (relief line to indicate puffed cheek) wears a himation (black border) over his shoulders and a pair of shoes (waist and thighs missing). He stoops slightly and has his left leg forward. His hair is receding and he has a red fillet round his head with three leaves at the front. Before him dances a naked woman: she moves to the right but looks back at the piper, her arms extended as she plays the krotala, one in either hand. Her hair is cut short and there is a thin red fillet with three leaves at the front in her hair. This pair is preceded by a bearded komast, also dancing, for his left foot is off the ground in front of him. He has a himation (black border) over his arms and shoulders that is pulled over the back of his head and holds a skyphos out in his left hand and a stick down in his right. He has a red fillet with three leaves at the front. In front of him is hung a spotted flute-case. On the far right a youth observes their approach, leaning on a stick. He is dressed in a himation that is pulled up over the back of his head and covers both his arms (part of his middle is missing). He has a red wreath around his head. Behind him is suspended a food basket, of which only the upper right hand corner, part of the red ties above and the red tassels below are preserved.

Attributed by Hartwig to Brygos and, after much reflection, given by Beazley to his Foundry Painter. At first, Beazley had followed Hartwig, although he did comment 'nicht sicher eigenhändig' (AV178). In ARV he placed the piece in the Manner of the Brygos Painter, together with a cup in Tarquinia (already given in VA 94 to the Foundry Painter, but removed again in AV 188-9), and by ARV2 he had moved both into the sphere of the Foundry Painter with the comment 'close to the Brygos Painter at his height, but hardly from his hand. They might be by the Foundry Painter at the point in his career when he was nearest to the Brygos Painter' (ARV2 405). By the time of his Feltrinelli lecture (RG, delivered in 1965) Beazley had clearly refined his position, for here he selected a small group of vases by the Foundry Painter, among which the Tarquinia cup played a special role (see RG 59 = Beazley Lectures 82), and both cups are added to the list of works by the Foundry Painter in Para (370-1 add as ARV2 402, 14 bis: the Tarquinia cup as 23 bis).
Alongside this pair of cups in particularly polished style one may place a fragmentary piece in Cahn's collection in Basel (inv. 714): interior, male and girl moving to right, she plays the pipes; exterior, komos and youths with flute girls - two frsgments in the collection of Miss E.D.B. Vermeule in Boston join the Cahn fragments. All these rather more refined and even works of the Foundry Painter continue on from the Toledo komos cup (64.126: Para 370, add as 12 bis; CVA Toledo 1, pls. 55-6) and represent the painter's fully mature work. They stand side by side with the Brygos Painter's fully mature middle work. The Foundry Painter's late works are not numerous: they seem rather stiffer than his mature works (e.g. ARV2 401, 10; 405, lower - Berlin inv. 3240; 401, 10 bis - Beazley Add2 231; London market [inside only, pair of acontists]).
Bloesch attributed the potting of the London cup to Brygos, as a later work.
The motif of the door occurs on a number of pyxides, see S. Rutherfurd Roberts, The Attic Pyxis (Chicago 1974) 181-3; it is more fully discussed in a Roman context in B. Haarlov, The Half-Open Door. A common Symbolic Motif within Roman Sepulchral Sculpture (Odense 1977)• A very similar door appears on a lekythos by the Brygos Painter (ARV2 384, 210). The Foundry Painter also depicts the open gates of Troy on his ambitious cup in Boston (ARV2 402, 23).
The leaves attached to some of the fillets are often referred to as vine leaves, but it has been argued that since wreaths of vine are not referred to in ancient sources, but ones of celery are, such leaves may really be of celery (see M. Blech, Studien zum Krantz bei den Griechen (Berlin 1982) 51-2 and 69). On anal intercourse see E.C. Keuls, The Reign of the Phallus (New York 1985) 176-9; cf. also K.J.

Those on the south flank of the temple included a series featuring human Lapiths in mortal combat with Centaurs. The Centaurs were part-man and part-horse, thus having a civil and a savage side to their nature. The Lapiths, a neighbouring Greek tribe, made the  mistake of giving the Centaurs wine at the marriage feast of their king,  Peirithoos. The Centaurs attempted to rape the women, with their leader Eurytion trying to carry off the bride. A general battle ensued, with the Lapiths finally victorious.
This scene on South Metope XXVIII is comparable with that on South metope VIII.

Attributions to find-spots are based on (1) Alfred Biliotti’s diary kept during excavations at Kamiros between November 1863 and June 1864, which records the contents of two votive deposits and over 300 graves; (2) entries in the Museum Register, often stipulating the find-spots of individual objects excavated by Biliotti; (3) the Kamiros tomb list, produced around the same time as his entries in the Museum Register. It lists the contents of each grave and votive deposit, along with their corresponding registration numbers; (4) the Kamiros index cards, written by Donald Bailey in the 1960’s.

Two fragmentary reliefs (1805,0703.266 and 267) described as ‘pilaster ornamented’ appear in a list in Townley’s hand headed ‘Marbles in the Dining Room’, inserted as fo. 1 in TY 12/6. To judge from their place in the list, they were mounted between the windows. They are not mentioned in 1804 Parlour Catalogue, but appear in Combe’s Supplementary List (dining room 2) as ‘Two upright pieces of Marble, about 4 feet high, & 8 inches wide, covered with vine and olive branches, in bas-relief’ (TY 18/4, cf. List of drawings, ca. 1786). This description confirms their identity. They were evidently in the dining room by about 1801, but I have found no other specific reference to them in Townley’s papers. Their source and precise date of acquisition therefore remain uncertain. Smith listed them among ‘Sculptures of modern or doubtful origin in the ancient manner’, but Thomas Ashby, then Director of the British School at Rome, wrote to him in 1913 pointing out to him their similarity to some fragmentary pilasters from Hadrian’s Villa, a drawing of one of which (Tivoli, Villa Adriana, Antiquarium inv. 423540) had been published by Pierre Gusman (La Villa impériale de Tibur (Paris, 1904), 241, fig. 369; see also J. Raeder, Die statuarische Ausstattung der Villa Hadriana bei Tivoli (Frankfurt, 1983), 301). Ashby suggested the same provenance for Townley’s fragments, adding ‘They may have come from Hamilton’s cava’. Ashby’s letter is pasted into Smith’s interleaved copy of his Catalogue, preserved in the library of the Department of Greece and Rome.

Two fragmentary reliefs (1805,0703.266 and 267) described as ‘pilaster ornamented’ appear in a list in Townley’s hand headed ‘Marbles in the Dining Room’, inserted as fo. 1 in TY 12/6. To judge from their place in the list, they were mounted between the windows. They are not mentioned in 1804 Parlour Catalogue, but appear in Combe’s Supplementary List (dining room 2) as ‘Two upright pieces of Marble, about 4 feet high, & 8 inches wide, covered with vine and olive branches, in bas-relief’ (TY 18/4, cf. List of drawings, ca. 1786). This description confirms their identity. They were evidently in the dining room by about 1801, but I have found no other specific reference to them in Townley’s papers. Their source and precise date of acquisition therefore remain uncertain. Smith listed them among ‘Sculptures of modern or doubtful origin in the ancient manner’, but Thomas Ashby, then Director of the British School at Rome, wrote to him in 1913 pointing out to him their similarity to some fragmentary pilasters from Hadrian’s Villa, a drawing of one of which (Tivoli, Villa Adriana, Antiquarium inv. 423540) had been published by Pierre Gusman (La Villa impériale de Tibur (Paris, 1904), 241, fig. 369; see also J. Raeder, Die statuarische Ausstattung der Villa Hadriana bei Tivoli (Frankfurt, 1983), 301). Ashby suggested the same provenance for Townley’s fragments, adding ‘They may have come from Hamilton’s cava’. Ashby’s letter is pasted into Smith’s interleaved copy of his Catalogue, preserved in the library of the Department of Greece and Rome.

Although empty, the eyes are sharply outlined and the faces carry hints of expression; the central female would seem to be almost smiling, while her companion on her left has a solemn considering look.
The suggestion that this panel represents the Presentation of the Bride to the Bodhisattva is recorded without contradiction or enthusiasm by Marshall. If such an identification is to be hazarded, the portly bearded figure may be the father of the bride or bridegroom, the leaner figure with a garland the family priest, and the woman between them Yaśodharā.; Zwalf 1985
By tradition the Bodhisattva married and this relief, with a woman standing in the centre, is interpreted as the presentation of the bride; on her left may be the family priest or her father.

This relief was once part of a larger panel which, in all probability, featured a Buddha figure at the centre and the Bodhisattva Padmapāṇi on the opposite side. The Buddha flanked by two Bodhisattvas was a common arrangement in Buddhist sculpture from early in its history. The representation of Vajrapāṇi shows that his iconography, at least in ancient Gandhāra, was in part derived from Hercules (see 1776.1108.2) who often wears a lion-skin in the same manner, recalling the hero's defeat of the Nemean Lion. Hercules was widely venerated as a hero and saviour in western Asia during the early centuries of the present era. As a great champion, who nevertheless understood the human condition, Hercules was easily assimilated into Mahāyāna Buddhism.
This relief, aside from its interest as a document of religious development, illustrates a well-known phenomenon in the history of art, namely, that images change in meaning before they change in appearance.; Zwalf 1996:
The manner of wearing the lion's skin is common in the iconography of Heracles (see Lexicon, 1981-8: iv, 7281F., 79iff.) and it derives from his slaying of the Nemean lion; the same style was adopted by or for rulers claiming descent from Heracles, among whom was Alexander the Great.

Almost in the centre of the space beside the doorway a horse stands on a rectangular platform with, on the outer side, two densely and irregularly spoked wheels; the horse's head, badly damaged in front, reaches almost to the top of the panel and looks slightly outwards towards the viewer. The body shows some modelling; the mane is a low ridge along the back of the neck. In front of the horse a male figure, bending towards it, legs flexed, holds a spear with a long narrow point in both hands against the animal; his right arm is badly damaged and only his left hand is visible in low relief on the shaft of the spear. He wears a girt knee-length tunic and probably a 'chlamys', damaged on the left and with no visible clasp or fibula. His legs are bare but above the ankles is a roll, probably at the top of low boots; the hair is apparently long and flowing but the outer side of the head is damaged and no hair seems to fall below the shoulders. Behind the horse, over the haunches, is the bust of a standing male wearing a garment densely ribbed for folds covering both shoulders, but for this figure there is no continuation below the horse's body and, although only an irregular vertical break is left of the head, it is tempting to think that he was bearded. Beside the horse's tail another male, in profile, appears to be pushing the horse with both arms, although only one hand is visible; he is perhaps wearing a cloak seen from the side and reaching below the knees, and the lower arm may be sleeved to the wrist with a thick material. His left shoulder and upper arm are badly gashed. On his legs rolls (of the tops of boots) are much clearer. The head is largely broken and, like that of the figure opposite, retains some features only on the inner side carved in probable asymmetry with those on the outer. Beside him is a slender shaft, inclining slightly to the right, with a curved and reattached shape at the top, all that is left of a spear and of an arm curving upwards behind it and ending in a hand holding it below the point.
On the left is a doorway containing a female figure standing almost frontally with both arms raised to the top of the lintel. She wears a lower garment, seemingly a paridhāna, with, on her left, a short and thick excess of material hanging, perhaps looped, from the girdle. This garment extends as far as the double anklets on both legs. Above the girdle she is naked except for a collar and a necklace hanging between the breasts, she wears hoop earrings and her thick hair falls on either side of the head. Above the head and joined to it is an irregularly broken projection, the height of the lintel and roughly in the form of an inverted cone, which readily suggests a lost mural crown (despite the usually quite different dress of the city-goddess in Gandhāra, far more, it would seem, than the chignon). The face is chubby with very full cheeks, somewhat suggesting a child; the mouth is a slit, but the eyes are open and ringed to show the upper and lower lids. On her undamaged left forearm are about five wristlets. The doorway has deeply moulded architraves. Only the bottom of the panel is framed and has a prominent plinth and torus below a fillet slanted back and suggesting a cavetto.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Peshawar District,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 5.40 centimetres; Height: 16.20 centimetres; Width: 32.30 centimetres,,"When first published (Hargreaves, 1926: 125), this piece, then in the possession of Mr (later Sir) Francis Wylie ICS, was said probably to have originated from one of the numerous mounds in the (then) Mardan subdivision of Peshawar District and in a printed version of an address to the Tibet Society of 1976, Sir Olaf Caroe, who knew Sir Francis Wylie, states that it came from the Swabi Tahsil, near Hund, a part of that subdivision. Wheeler's suggestion (1968: 137), on the other hand, that the piece came from Charsada, not in the Mardan subdivision, is supported by Sir Francis Wylie's having been Assistant Commissioner at Charsada from May 1919 to May 1921.

The five pitchers by this hand (GGP 71, XIII.5-9) are as homogeneous in style as they are consistent in their unusual iconography; especially close is K 83 in the collection of the British School at Athens, from the Kynosarges cemetery (BSA 98 [2003], 338, fig. 1, pl. 45). Interpretation of the scenes depends on what view is taken of the central checked base and the spindle-like objects held by the seated figures. The LG pitcher being exclusively a funerary vessel, it is reasonable to see the central structure as a grave, with the shield(s) of the warrior resting upon it. The spindle-like objects could either be purificatory sprinklers shaped like pomegranates (Hahland, above) or, more plausibly, percussive instruments to scare off evil spirits from the grave, whether as rattles (Cook, above) or as cymbals (J. Boardman, JHS 86 [1966], 5). An alternative interpretation (Ahlberg, above) derives the iconography from Neohittite stone reliefs showing banqueters facing across a table at a funeral. One might wonder, however, what access LG II Athenian vase painters could have had to the imagery of Near Eastern monumental sculpture.

Townley's description; ‘A head bearing a helmet, and placed upon a Terminus, with the name of Pericles, thus inscribed upon it, ПΕΡΙΚΛΕΣ.  The portrait of this great warrior and legislator was not known in these days, until this Terminus, and another similar to it , but of a more modern style of sculpture, were discovered 1780 at the pianella [sic, for Pianura] di Cassio before mentioned’ (TY 12/3, street drawing room 20). The inscription actually reads ΠΕΡΙΚΛΗΣ.
The discovery of a portrait of Pericles with the name inscribed in an excavation sponsored by Pope Pius VI  in the ‘Oliveto’ at Tivoli was reported by Hamilton on 17 April 1779 (TY 7/630). Hamilton had himself found a similar piece at the lake of Castiglione (TY 7/632, 18 May 1779). He hoped to obtain one for Townley, and negotiations with Visconti dragged on to 1783. In the end, it was acquired by Volpato, who sold it to Hamilton for 200 Scudi, to which Hamilton added 12 Scudi for transport before charging Townley £50 (TY 7/660, 13 August 1783, cf. TY 10/3, fo. 36). On 10 January 1784 Hamilton, wrote that it had been found in the ‘Oliveto’ in the same cava as the copy in the Vatican (TY 7/622). This site was also sometimes described as the ‘Pianella di Cassio’ (TY 12/5, TY 12/19/1), but now more simply as the ‘Villa di Cassio’. On the site, which was excavated by Domenico de Angelis, see T. Ahby, ‘The Classical Topography of the Roman Campagna II’, PBSR 3 (1906), 191-2.

Townley's description; ‘A head of Homer, ending in a Terminus, found 1780 near Baiæ’(TY 12/3, library 22).
The different dates for the discovery given in earlier sources (1781 in the ‘Union Catalogue’, fo. 21v; 1782 in the First Townley Inventory, head 18; and 1783 in TY 10/3) are all shown to be wrong by Hamilton’s letter offering the head in April 1780 (TY /641).
Bought from Hamilton in late 1780 for £80. 
In 1780, Hamilton sold Townley a terminal bust of Homer (1805,0703.85) and a head of Diana (1805,0703.61). They were first offered in April at £100 and £60 respectively (TY 7/641), but in July the prices were reduced to £80 and £40, and at the same time Hamilton sent drawings (TY 7/643). Townley was in no hurry to decide, partly because there was at that time some possibility of acquiring sculptures that were due to arrive in Italy from Greece, as Hamilton reminded him on 10 September (TY 7/644), and partly because he was short of ready money, his tenants being slow to pay their rents (see 1805,0703.40). On 5 December, Townley confirmed that he wanted both items, suggesting that they should be sent from Leghorn in a neutral ship (TY 6/1, fo. 14).  Hamilton acknowledged this letter on 10 January 1781 (TY 7/645), and on 1 March (TY 7/646) wrote that shipping of the two sculptures had been delayed in the hope of obtaining the portrait of Pericles (1805,0703.91). On 20 March, Townley replied that the heads of Homer and Diana could wait until peace was settled unless a neutral ship could be found (TY 6/1, fo. 19). On 3 July 1781 (TY 7/647), Hamilton reported that they had been embarked for Leghorn together with the bust of a faun (present location unknown, Cook 2011, nr. 243). Townley was still worried about the safety of the sculptures, and reiterated on 1 August that they were only to be entrusted to a safe ship (TY 6/1, fo. 30-1). In the same letter, he confirmed that he was short of money, being unable to send the £300 requested by Hamilton, although he would try to send £150. On 12 September (TY 7/655/1), Hamilton enclosed a letter from Thomas Panton at Leghorn (TY 7/655/2, dated 9 September) stating that Townley’s consignment was to go via Ostend. The ship duly sailed, but disaster struck off the coast of Spain. It was at first reported that the ship had been lost near Cadiz, but on 14 June 1782, Townley was able to report that it was only stranded, and that the cargo had been deposited under the Admiralty at Cadiz, from whom it could be reclaimed with a Bill of Lading, and was then to be shipped either back to Leghorn or, preferably, to England (TY 6/1, fo. 41-2). The process was slow. Hamilton wrote on 12 April 1783 that he had no news of the cases (TY 7/657), and although he added on 20 June that Panton had shipped the Homer to England (TY 7/659), he had to report on 10 January 1784, that he had received a letter from Panton to the effect that Homer was still a ‘prisoner of war’ (TY 7/662). It was not until 17 July 1784 that Hamilton was able to congratulate Townley that Homer and his companions had been recovered (TY 7/663). The whole process of negotiation and shipping had lasted over four years.

This necropolis was excavated from the mid-19th century on in a poorly recorded manner and most of the finds were dispersed. The lack of documented contexts poses difficulties with regard to the chronology of the busts; epigraphic evidence broadly places the series between c. 300 BC and 82 BC (when Praeneste was destroyed by the Roman general Sulla). On stylistic grounds, a date of around 200 BC was proposed for this example.
A Praenestine limestone bust of similar dimensions is mentioned in Notizie degli Scavi  of 1907 (p. 24) as untraced. It may be this bust, but this is impossible to prove.

Provenance: Presented to the sitter 'by his pupils, Cockerell, Burn, Vulliamy and others';(1) presented by Captain Lambert, the sitter's son-in-law, 1895 (BM Archive, Minutes, 9 February 1895, C19,630).
Sir Robert Smirke was the second son of Robert Smirke, a painter who was elected to the Royal Academy in 1793, and brother of Sir Edward (1795-1875) and Sydney Smirke (1798-1877). He was born in London. In 1796 he enrolled in the Royal Academy Schools, and was awarded medals by the Society of Arts as well as the Academy. He was briefly articled to Sir John Soane. In 1805-6 he studied in Italy, Greece and Sicily, publishing 'Specimens of Continental Architecture' in 1806. His earliest buildings after his return, for example Eastnor Castle and Lowther, were medieval in style. However, he soon adopted a classical repertoire, heavily dependent on the Doric or Ionic order, used when he rebuilt Covent Garden (burned in 1856) in 1809. His first project at the British Museum was the construction of the Temporary Elgin Gallery, 1816. In 1823 Smirke was asked to present designs for a new Museum to replace Montagu House, which was not completed until after 1846 when Sydney Smirke took over. A charming sketch by George Scharf I of 1844-5 shows Smirke and ""persons employed under him for the rebuilding of the British Museum"".(2)
Elected Associate of the Royal Academy in 1808, Smirke became an Academician in 1811. He was Treasurer of the Academy from 1820 to 1850. His knighthood, awarded in 1832, was given for work as one of three official architects to the Board of Works. His design submitted to the competition for the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament in 1834 was not accepted. His achievements were recognized in 1853 by the award of the Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Smirke retired from practice in 1845 and from public life in 1859 when he left London for Cheltenham.
Thomas Campbell was born in Edinburgh and was apprenticed to a marble-cutter named John Marshall, later transferring to his successor James Dalzell. A patron, Gilbert Innes, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Scotland, enabled him to attend the Royal Academy Schools, where he was admitted on 8 January 1818 as a mature student. He seems to have worked for E. H. Baily (see registration no. 1855,0811.3) around 1817. In 1818, assisted by Innes, he went to Rome, where he had a studio at 12 Piazza Mignanelli by 1824.(3) One of his earliest patrons was the Duke of Devonshire, who commissioned him to execute a statue of Princess Pauline Borghese. Campbell took casts of her hands and feet and later reproduced them in silver and bronze. By 1827 he had become the doyen of Scottish sculptors in Rome.(4) Campbell returned to England in 1830, residing in Leicester Square, although he retained his studio in Rome and returned to Italy to purchase marble. He exhibited at the Academy from 1827 to 1857, latterly from his house in Marlborough Square.(5) Many of his recorded works were for Scottish clients, including the Duke of Buccleuch, for whom he worked in 1847.(6) He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.
In 1833 Thomas Campbell contributed £5 towards the purchase of the bronzes of Siris, together with Benedetto Pistrucci (£5), Mr R. Westmacott (£10) and W. R. Hamilton (£20).(7) T. L. Donaldson, in an appreciation of his work in 1858,(8) comments on Campbell's ability to seize ""the individual likeness of his sitter"" and give the portrait ""a sentiment and expression highly characteristic"". Whilst criticizing Campbell's lack of imagination, he wrote that he spared no pains to give his works the utmost perfection of finish. Although the marble is heavily veined in one place, the sculptor has made sure that the impurity is not immediately visible, by hiding it at the back. The warm tone of the clothing suggests that Campbell cut away other impurities so that the face appears white and blemish-free.(9) The liveliness of this bust with its carefully carved classical-style drapery, under which is a shirt in a more romantic idiom, is partly achieved by the slight turn of the head and the semi-circular incision for the pupils. The bust is highly polished.
The socle is made from statuary marble from Polvaccio, Torano basin (E.Dolci, 'Carrara Cave Antichi: Materiali Archeologici', Carrara, 1980, no. XI, p. 163).

Townley's description; ‘A head of Periander, Tyrant of Corinth, and one of the seven wise men of Greece; it belonged to pope Sixtus ye fifth, but remained an unknown portrait in his Villa, before mentioned, until a head, exactly similar to this, was lately found at the Pianura di Cassio near Tivoli, with the name of Periander upon it.  See Mus. Pio. Vol. 1. pag.13.’ (TY 12/3, dining room 48). The inscribed herm is now in the Vatican (Vat. Cat. III, 1, no. 531, pl. 27, G. M. A. Richter, Portraits of the Greeks, 3 vols. (London, 1965) I, 86, no.1).  The identification of Townley’s example as Periander is dubious (Bernoulli, Smith, Richter).
Purchased from Jenkins for £40 (TY 7/441, 29 July 1786). Although Jenkins had described the head as ‘very fine’ and had assured Townley that Visconti had vouched for the identification (TY 7/433, 15 February 1786), Townley was disappointed with it and proposed to return it at is own expense if Jenkins could find a purchaser in Rome at the price Townley had paid, although he did not want Jenkins himself to be ‘encumbered again with it on [his] own account’ (note dated 26 December 1786, attached to TY 7/447). Whether Jenkins took this comment as an excuse for inaction cannot be known, but although he wrote on 13 January 1787 (TY 7/449/1) that he was sorry the Periander did not answer Townley’s expectations, the head remained in Townley’s collection.
Jenkins wrote to Townley on 28 September 1785 that he had acquired ‘all the Antiquities in the Villa Negroni’ (TY 7/427/1), and over the course of the following year, Townley purchased five items (1805,0703.119; 1805,0703.44; 1805,0703.123; 1805,0703.88; and three pieces of the same sarcophagus 1805,0703.125; 1805,0703.126; 1805,0703.130). Four more (1805,0703.140; 1805,0703.120; 1805,0703.180; 1805,0703.182) were to follow in 1777-8.

With supports at the back of the neck, there can be no doubt of the original context of these heads as figures from a lid of a sarcophagus. Isotopic analysis of both heads suggests they were cut from one block of Pentelic marble and thus belonged to the same sarcophagus. The findspot suggests an association with the chest described above. The association of both heads with the chest, noted by Smith in his respective catalogue entries, has been overlooked by subsequent writers. With reference to the 'peopled' acanthus scroll at the base of the chest, Toynbee and Ward-Perkins dated the chest to the early third century; Giuliano and Palma also favoured an early date.(1) Redlich's date of AD 230-50 has been followed by Kallipolitis and Koch and Sichtermann.(2)
The iconographical dependence of Attic Amazonomachy sarcophagi on the Trojan battle series, also of Attic origin, is well known and has been noted with reference to the London sarcophagus.(3) The latter, from Sidon, is remarkably similar in composition and technique to a Trojan battle sarcophagus found at Tyre.(4) Both are dated to just before AD 250 in Koch and Sichtermann's chronological table, in tacit recognition of their contemporaneity.(5) More recently, the Tyre sarcophagus has been dated to AD 250—60,(6) and a later date may also be argued for the London sarcophagus on the basis of the portraits. The male head has some of the qualities of a head from the Athenian Agora, used by Harrison to illustrate the end of the 'realistic' style favoured in mid-third century Athens.(7) It may even be compared to a Gallienic head from Athens illustrated by Bergmann.(8) The female portrait shares some of the characteristics of a head from Athens dated by Bergmann to the Gallienic period, but lacks the extreme severity and angularity of a Gallienic provincial portrait from Beirut.(9) It could also be argued that the classicism of the composition, a feature much emphasised by Giuliano and Palma, may reflect the so-called Gallienic renaissance of interest in classical form.(10)

Literary sources claim that Alexander selected only a few artists to produce his image. Famous names, such as the sculptor Lysippos and the painter Apelles, were associated with Alexander's portraiture. None of the famous images have been identified, but a vast array of sculptures in different materials, portraits on gemstones and coins survive. These were produced mostly long after Alexander's death, and while the portraits follow similar general characteristics, they also vary in style. A relatively large number of portraits of Alexander have been found in Egypt, ranging in date from Hellenistic to Roman.
Alexander was always shown clean-shaven, which was an innovation: all previous portraits of Greek statesmen or rulers had beards. This royal fashion lasted for almost five hundred years and almost all of the Hellenistic kings and Roman emperors until Hadrian were portrayed beardless. Alexander was the first king to wear the royal diadem, a band of cloth tied around the hair that was to become the symbol of Hellenistic kingship. His portrait types were utilized and adapted for images of later rulers. Earlier portraits of Alexander tend to appear more heroic and mature, while posthumous portraits, like this example, portray Alexander as a more youthful, god-like character. He has longer hair, a more dynamic twist of the head and an upward gaze; in fact, more like the description of Alexander in literary sources.
This head was acquired in Alexandria, the city that Alexander had founded after he conquered Egypt in 332 bc. Ptolemy had been one of Alexander's Macedonian generals and he was given Egypt in the division of Alexander's lands after his death. Alexandria was also the location of Alexander's tomb. From the time Ptolemy I Soter declared himself king in 305/304 bc, Alexander was worshipped as a god and as the forefather of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

The ancient upper part of the relief is distinguishable from the eighteenth-century restoration by the break line running through the neck, breast and arm of Apollo, on the left, and the upper thighs and wings of the figure of Victory on the right. The restoration cleverly completes the authentic fragment, with its mannered archaising style. The restored figures would have been copied from one of the other surviving examples of this subject known in Hamilton's day.
In the eighteenth century, one of the great sculpture collections in Rome was housed in the Villa Albani, where Johann Winckelmann served as secretary to Cardinal Alessandro Albani while compiling his History of Ancient Art. In this publication Winckelmann discusses one of five examples of this type of relief which were then in the Albani collection. The one he describes and illustrates is the most complete and alone remains in the Villa. It shows three deities, Leto, Artemis and Apollo, approaching an altar at which stands a winged figure of Victory. She pours a libation from a jug into a bowl, which she passes to Apollo. As the god of Music he supports a stringed instrument (kithara) and plucks the strings with his left hand.
The exaggerated gestures, the raising of heels off the ground and the flying, swallow-tailed drapery are all typical of the archaising style of sculpture in the Roman period. Winckelmann rightly recognised the relief as archaising rather than archaic: 'At first glance', he says, 'it seems to be Etruscan, but the architecture of the building contradicts it. It seems, therefore, that this is the work of a Greek master, not of the older time, but one who wished to copy the style of that time.' D'Hancarville was characteristically more interested in the subject matter than in the style. He took the figure of Apollo to be Erato, the Muse of erotic verse, receiving a patera from a winged genius of poetry. The latter pours a libation destined for the 'altar of desire'.
The figure of Victory from this same relief was copied by Nathaniel Marchant for a sard intaglio said, in Marchant's own catalogue, to be 'From a small Etruscan basso-rilievo, formerly in the possession of the Rt. Hon. Sir William Hamilton, K.B. now in the British Museum'.

The cart is drawn by a pair of yoked oxen. They are goaded from the front by a man dressed in a short-sleeved tunic: only his right arm and the goad are preserved.(1) The wineskin is supported by a wooden frame. The cart has solid wheels (tympana). A dog runs beneath it, behind the oxen. In the background a man dressed in an exomis raises his right hand as if to welcome the cart. Despite his casual dress, his pose and location suggest that this is a person of authority, possibly the dominus of the estate. He stands in an archway apparently built of ashlar masonry. The rounded piers of a second arch or arcade appear behind the man holding the goad. The workmanship is lively and naturalistic. There are some 'pointilliste' elements in the use of the drill, notably in the decoration alongside the index finger of the man holding the goad, in the facial hair and features of the animals, and in the hair and hand of the man standing beneath the arch. The style suggests a date of c. AD 275-300.
This is one of a group of lids depicting scenes from country life made in Rome in the later third and early fourth century AD.(2) A lid in the Museo Nazionale delle Terme, Rome, shows a similar scene.(3) The dominus, here on horseback, bearded and dressed in tunic and cloak, raises his hand in a gesture similar to that of the man standing in the arch on the London relief. This lid is dated to the Tetrarchic period. As Koch and Sichtermann point out (see n. 2), such scenes, which are largely restricted to lids, appear in association with a variety of scenes on chests, and cannot therefore be used as indicators of the decoration of the latter.

Bought from Albacini in April 1777 for 3.20 Scudi, including a tip (TY 8/51, cf. the copy of Albacini’s receipt dated 10 April 1777, TY 8/107). This was one of the marbles left behind by Townley in Albacini’s care when he left Rome. It appears on a list of objects to be sent to London (TY 10/13) as ‘Frammento di basso relievo con Bovi’ and in draft of a letter from Townley to Jenkins dated 12 August 1777 (TY 7/372/2) as ‘the bass relievo of the carro con due bovi’. It was probably one of three marbles still at Albacini’s in January 1780 (TY 7/390), which were sent from Rome to Leghorn a few days before 19 July 1780 (TY 7/396).  
A marginal note in a copy of the Guide in the library of the Department of Greece and Rome, ‘T. in mss.’, was overlooked by Smith.

The female figure is adapted from Hellenistic images of Artemis as goddess of nature.(1) The execution of the frieze is similar to that of the sarcophagus from the Tomb of Caecilia Metella on the Via Appia, now in the Palazzo Farnese, Rome, and a sarcophagus in Salonica decorated with a scene from the underworld, possibly the judgement of Orestes.(2) The latter is dated by Giuliano and Palma to c. AD 185 and by Koch and Sichtermann to AD 200-25.(3) As in the case of Walker, no. 44 (1861.0220.1), there seems no good reason to doubt Giuliano and Palma's earlier dating; the rendering is spirited and naturalistic, and the formal decorative mouldings are carved in high relief with rounded forms.

Another fragment believed to be from the same chest was found by Ludwig Ross, and is now in Sparta Museum (1). 
Though isotopic analysis strongly suggests that the marble of this fragment is Proconnesian from Asia Minor,(2) the iconography follows the canon of Attic sarcophagi. To date, this is the only securely identified Proconnesian sarcophagus in southern Greece.(3) It is one of a series of sarcophagi from Sparta, which have long been considered the products of a local workshop making for Spartan clients versions of Attic sarcophagi in Pentelic marble, sent overland from Athens in the form of roughly hollowed chests.(4) Such a lengthy journey over difficult terrain seems improbable, and it is likely that this chest was sent from Proconnesus by sea via Gytheum. Many of the better preserved Spartan sarcophagi appear to be of Pentelic marble; these too are likely to have been sent by sea.
With no full publication, it remains difficult to evaluate and date the Spartan series.(5) On the London fragment, the flattened ovolo moulding, with the elements of the design widely separated, suggests a date in the third century AD. Many of the figures are carved in low relief, which is to be expected on the back of a sarcophagus. However, the horse in the centre is well carved, and there is notable incised detail on the shields of both parties, and on the armour of the Greeks. These factors may indicate a Severan date.(6) To my knowledge the London fragment is unique among Roman Amazonomachy sarcophagi in representing two Greek soldiers in cuirasses protected by scales. This feature, and the lack of moulded cavetto beneath the ovolo, sets the fragment apart from other members of the Attic series, and may reflect its non-Athenian origin.

		With supports at the back of the neck, there can be no doubt of the  original context of these heads as figures from a lid of a sarcophagus.  Isotopic analysis of both heads suggests they were cut from one block  of Pentelic marble and thus belonged to the same sarcophagus. The  findspot suggests an association with the chest described above. The  association of both heads with the chest, noted by Smith in his  respective catalogue entries, has been overlooked by subsequent  writers. With reference to the 'peopled' acanthus scroll at the base of  the chest, Toynbee and Ward-Perkins dated the chest to the early  third century; Giuliano and Palma also favoured an early date.(1)  Redlich's date of AD 230-50 has been followed by Kallipolitis and  Koch and Sichtermann.(2)
		The iconographical dependence of Attic Amazonomachy sarcophagi  on the Trojan battle series, also of Attic origin, is well known and has  been noted with reference to the London sarcophagus.(3) The latter,  from Sidon, is remarkably similar in composition and technique to a  Trojan battle sarcophagus found at Tyre.(4) Both are dated to just  before AD 250 in Koch and Sichtermann's chronological table, in tacit  recognition of their contemporaneity.(5) More recently, the Tyre  sarcophagus has been dated to AD 250—60,(6) and a later date may  also be argued for the London sarcophagus on the basis of the  portraits. The male head has some of the qualities of a head from the  Athenian Agora, used by Harrison to illustrate the end of the 'realistic'  style favoured in mid-third century Athens.(7) It may even be  compared to a Gallienic head from Athens illustrated by Bergmann.(8)  The female portrait shares some of the characteristics of a head from  Athens dated by Bergmann to the Gallienic period, but lacks the  extreme severity and angularity of a Gallienic provincial portrait from  Beirut.(9) It could also be argued that the classicism of the  composition, a feature much emphasised by Giuliano and Palma, may  reflect the so-called Gallienic renaissance of interest in classical form.

The practice of making composite statues was long established in the ancient Middle East, but none of any size survives intact. The tradition was carried on to Greece, where some of the finest divine images were described as chryselephantine (ivory and gold). The figure to which this head belonged may have been the base of a giant column.
Unlike the human-headed winged lions and bulls, the clean-shaven sphinx is not typically Assyrian, though like them it was regarded as having protective magical powers. It was adopted from the west, where it was at home in Syrian art, and constitutes another example of Assyrian willingness to accept foreign ideas.

The head is a little under life size and is made in a naturalistic style. It has a headdress, suggesting a crown, of complex construction. The main tubular section of the crown runs around the head in a three-layer composition. The upper layer has a band of four horizontal rectangles representing flat, discoidal beads surmounted by a red-painted tubular bead and a tasssel. The central layer has a row of vertical rectangles representing tubular beads with tassels. The lower layer has a row of rosettes painted in red. The main tubular section of the crown also has a projecting arc around the forehead comprising small tubular beads edged with a row of red-painted feathers. At the back of the crown is a neck cover. The central part of the cover has eighteen vertical elements incised to indicate plaitwork with traces of black paint. The bottom and sides have a row of red-painted rosettes. A crest rises above the central crown at the front. It comprises a conical roundel with central boss surrounded by seven concentric rings, problably representing beads. A plaitwork element rises behind the roundel, it terminates in a pointed ovoid tip; both elements bear traces of black paint. 
The face is slightly elongated and has vertical incised markings (striations). Two lines of holes run between the lobes of the ears, one going through the angle of the neck and the jaw, the second crossing the jaw below the lower lip. A double line of holes runs across the upper lip. The almond-shaped eyes are small in proportion to the head and the eyebrow-ridge is sharply defined. The lips are not striated.
There are grooves round the front of the neck representing skin creases. There are holes pierced through the neck at the front and at both sides. There is a large irregular hole on the right proper side of the jaw.",,,,,Yoruba,,,14thC-15thC(early) (probably),Made in: Ife,Excavated/Findspot: Ife,brass,,,lost-wax cast; incised; painted,Height: 35 centimetres; Weight: 5.10 kilograms; Width: 12.50 centimetres; Depth: 15 centimetres,,"This free-standing brass head cast in the lost wax technique was discovered in 1938 at Wunmonije Compound in Ife, Nigeria. It was found by accident during house building works together with sixteen other brass and copper heads and the upper half of a brass figure. 
The identification and function of the head, in common with the others discovered at this site, remain uncertain. Its elaborate beaded headdress, possibly representing a crown, suggest that it was associated with an Ooni, a ruler of Ife.  
According to the oral traditions of the Yoruba people, Ife is the place where life and civilisation began. Ife is regarded as the legendary homeland of theYoruba-speaking peoples and its sacred ruler, the Ooni, is still revered as the descendant of the original creator gods. Ife is located in Osun State in modern south-western Nigeria.
Ife began to develop as a city-state in the late first millennium, around AD 800 and became a leading political, economic and spiritual centre in the lower Niger region. Between 1100 and 1400 it floursihed as a commercial centre with access to the lucrative trade networks along the Niger River. 
The art of Ife has produced a large corpus of sculptural works in terracotta, stone, brass and copper which were found at different sites in the city. Among these artworks the representations of humans are striking for their naturalistic style. This life-like modelling is unique in Africa and when objects from Ife were first presented to the western world they were compared with the classical traditions of Ancient Greece and Rome. It was even suggested that such heads were evidence that Ife was the site of the lost civilization of Atlantis. In fact the sculpture of Ife is today rightly seen as one of the highest achievements of African art and culture.

Townley's description; ‘A Head of Juno with a fillet-diadem, tied round the hair, larger than life’ (1804 Parlour Catalogue, street parlour 7). The subject has been variously identified: Combe called the head ‘Juno Placida’ in his receipt (TY 18/6), but later preferred ‘Dione’ (Ancient Marbles of the British Museum); Richard Payne Knight suggested ‘Venus’ or ‘Dione’ (Specimens of Ancient Sculpture. Selected from Different Collections in Great Britain, by the Society of Dilettanti (London, 1809-1835)); Ellis described the head simply as female ‘with no distinctive attributes’; Newton also declined to suggest a specific identification (Guide); and Smith ventured ‘Aphrodite (?)’. F. N. Pryce left a manuscript note in the interleaved copy of Smith’s Catalogue in the library of the Department of Greece and Rome: ‘Athena: had a helmet.  Hair originally painted and gilt: traces observed on left side by FNP (1.II.28)’.
I have been unable to identify this head with any of Townley’s recorded purchases, and have found no reference to it earlier than 1804, when it was in the street parlour (1804 Parlour Catalogue). The modern bust on which the head was originally mounted is 1922,0504.25.

This head, worked to fit into a statue, was purchased by Charles Townley in London in 1778 from another English collector, Lyde Browne, who had acquired it in 1775 at the sale of the collection of Dr Anthony Askew. Askew is said to have brought the head to London from Greece in 1740.
Within the British Museum the head has had a chequered existence. Condemned as a forgery, it was passed from Greek and Roman to British and Medieval Antiquities. In 1967 it was returned, its reputation heightened by association with the other antiquities brought from Greece by Askew, which are of undoubted authenticity. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine a workshop of forgers active in Athens before 1740.
However, the head is clearly not a contemporary portrait of Nero (AD 54-68). The crude cutting of the eyes and fringe are untypical of Roman work in first-century Greece. The features bear little relation to the two surviving representations in stone of the coin portrait of AD 64, on which the head is based.
If it is not entirely an eighteenth-century creation, the head may have been substantially recut to attract collectors. A possible motive may have been collectors' enthusiasm for Nero, one of the subjects of Suetonius' biographies 'The Twelve Caesars', and the lack of surviving ancient portraits of him. Hadrian was excluded from the biographies, and the head of Nero may have been recut from one of this emperor, of which many examples have survived in Greece. The original must have been wreathed, to judge by the exaggerated height of Nero's fringe and the depth of hair at the nape of his neck. Though wreaths were not generally a feature of his coiffure, a head of Hadrian from an over-life-sized cuirassed statue with oak wreath, now in Chania Museum (Crete), gives some notion of the possible original form of this portrait.

Townley's description; ‘A Head of Diana, size of large life, belonging to a statue, that is lost;  The hair, drawn up from the sides, is tied in a knot at the top of the head, and on the back part it forms a tuft, which projects.  It was sent from Rome by Mr Gavin Hamilton’ (1804 Parlour Catalogue, library 13).
There is no reliable evidence for the findspot. The statement in TY 10/3, fo. 36, that it was ‘found near Baia 1783 [emended to 1782]’ is probably copied from the immediately preceding entry in that transcript (the head of Homer, 1805,0703.85), where the date is again wrong.
Bought from Hamilton in late 1780 for £40. 
In 1780, Hamilton sold Townley a terminal bust of Homer (1805, 0703.85) and a head of Diana (1805,0703.61). They were first  offered in April at £100 and £60 respectively (TY 7/641), but in July  the prices were reduced to £80 and £40, and at the same time  Hamilton sent drawings (TY 7/643). Townley was in no hurry to  decide, partly because there was at that time some possibility of  acquiring sculptures that were due to arrive in Italy from Greece, as  Hamilton reminded him on 10 September (TY 7/644), and partly  because he was short of ready money, his tenants being slow to pay  their rents (see 1805,0703.40). On 5 December, Townley confirmed  that he wanted both items, suggesting that they should be sent from  Leghorn in a neutral ship (TY 6/1, fo. 14).  Hamilton acknowledged  this letter on 10 January 1781 (TY 7/645), and on 1 March (TY 7/646)  wrote that shipping of the two sculptures had been delayed in the  hope of obtaining the portrait of Pericles (1805,0703.91). On 20  March, Townley replied that the heads of Homer and Diana could wait  until peace was settled unless a neutral ship could be found (TY 6/1,  fo. 19). On 3 July 1781 (TY 7/647), Hamilton reported that they had  been embarked for Leghorn together with the bust of a faun (present  location unknown, Cook 2011, nr. 243). Townley was still worried  about the safety of the sculptures, and reiterated on 1 August that  they were only to be entrusted to a safe ship (TY 6/1, fo. 30-1). In the  same letter, he confirmed that he was short of money, being unable to  send the £300 requested by Hamilton, although he would try to send  £150. On 12 September (TY 7/655/1), Hamilton enclosed a letter from  Thomas Panton at Leghorn (TY 7/655/2, dated 9 September) stating  that Townley’s consignment was to go via Ostend. The ship duly  sailed, but disaster struck off the coast of Spain. It was at first  reported that the ship had been lost near Cadiz, but on 14 June  1782, Townley was able to report that it was only stranded, and that  the cargo had been deposited under the Admiralty at Cadiz, from  whom it could be reclaimed with a Bill of Lading, and was then to be  shipped either back to Leghorn or, preferably, to England (TY 6/1, fo.  41-2). The process was slow. Hamilton wrote on 12 April 1783 that he  had no news of the cases (TY 7/657), and although he added on 20  June that Panton had shipped the Homer to England (TY 7/659), he  had to report on 10 January 1784, that he had received a letter from  Panton to the effect that Homer was still a ‘prisoner of war’ (TY 7/662) . It was not until 17 July 1784 that Hamilton was able to congratulate  Townley that Homer and his companions had been recovered (TY 7/ 663). The whole process of negotiation and shipping had lasted over  four years.

Also registered with this object was a silver coin of Idalion dating 'slightly before 500 B.C.' according to the register (1887,8-1.3) and a silver boss from a shield (1887,8-1.3). The comments in the register state that the tomb also contained 'gold cups, with acorns repoussé; electrum ring with engraving of boat of the sun; large bronze vessel; many black figure vases; no red figd. vases...and additional items'.

The crocodile’s head might originally have contained a pipe for a fountain, as in a similar piece currently in Rome, where the acrobat contains a pipe (Hill; recognised as acrobat by Combe).
Presented to Townley by the first Baron Cawdor (not, as stated by Smith, the first Earl) by 1796. Two sculptures (1805,0703.25 and 6) brought from Rome were presented to Townley by John Campbell, first Baron Cawdor. Since the earlier documents that mention them refer to the donor as ‘Mr Campbell of Stackpole’, the gift presumably antedated 21 June 1796, when the Barony of Cawdor was created (for the date, see Burke’s Peerage, s.v. Cawdor). This is consistent with the appearance of 1805,0703.25 in the watercolour of the dining room by Chambers, for which Townley paid in March 1796 (Wigan Accounts).

This fragment is part of the colossal statue dedicated by the Naxians to Apollo at Delos, of which the base remains in situ; it is inscribed on both sides.
The figure is generally identified with the ‘great statue of the Naxians’ which, according to Plutarch (Nicias, 3), was overturned by the fall of a brazen palm-tree which had been dedicated by Nicias in 418 B.C. The date of this fall is unknown.
The statue represented the god as nude and standing with the left foot advanced and the forearms bent forward. The long hair fell on the shoulders and was embellished with curls in metal; round the waist was a metal belt. Besides the base and the fragment of foot here described, two fragments have been found at Delos, at some distance from the base; the torso from neck to waist, and part of the thighs; Deonna, op. cit., figs. 84 (base), 85, 87, 88 (torso), 86, 89 (thighs); Reinach, Repertoire, IV, p. 45, 2, 3.
The first modern traveller who saw the statue was Bondelmonte (about A.D. 1420), who found it prostrate, and says that he made an unsuccessful attempt to set it up (Liber Insularum Archipelagi, ed. Sinner, p. 92, and see Rev. Arch., 1883, I, p. 79). In 1445 Cyriac of Ancona sketched the base with one foot still in position (Bull. d. Inst., 1861, p. 182). The head was still intact in 1655 when Thevenot saw it (Voyages, Paris, 1689, I, p. 332), but had disappeared by 1675, when Spon heard that a little time previously a provedittore of Tinos had sawn the face away (Voyage de Dalmatie, etc., Lyon, 1678, I, p. 179), and Wheler in the same year recorded a tradition that head, hands, and feet had been carried off by an Englishman of the name of Mr. Simon, in 1672, and that previous to this the statue was upright on its base (Journey, p. 56); this last detail is obviously a fiction. Tournefoot in 1700 found only the fragments extant at present (Engl. ed. of 1740, vol. I, pl. facing p. 303); they were seen by Leake in 1806, afterwards lost to view, and finally recovered by L. Ross in 1835. On the whole history see S. Reinach in B.C.H., 1893, pp. 129-144; further bibliography is given in Deonna, op. cit., pp. 198, 199.

The figure is depicted with short stylised curly hair, set high on the forehead and with the small sized ears exposed. The detailed curls follow a slightly irregular line across the brow. The facial features have been executed to a high quality, with subtle modelling of the youthful skin across the forehead, slightly sunken skin under the eyes, prominent cheekbones, and a pronounced jawline. The eyes are wide and almond shaped, with a heavy upper eyelid and sharply defined brow which is set close to the eyes and converges with the bridge of the nose. The hooked nose is long and slim, with a clear cupid’s bow at the upper lip. The lips are slightly parted with a much fuller lower lip, and the outer corners and lower lip sharply incised. On the reverse the curled hairstyle continues down the nape of the neck, and there appears to be no surviving trace of a back-pillar.

The statue head, broken off from the neck, has also suffered damage to the tip of the nose and the tops of both ears with part of the right ear now missing.

The stylistic features and the contrast of the smoothed face and unpolished curls of the hair are noted to resemble other surviving heads which combine Egyptian and Greek artistic characteristics (James and Davies 1983).

The head is described as originating from Alexandria, however a more precise findspot is uncertain (PM VIII).

There is no record of the discovery of this head by Lord Elgin's agents, but opinion has for many years pointed to the Acropolis of Athens as the most probable finding-place; and a comparison has been suggested with a Sphinx found in the Acropolis in 1883 (Dickins, Acropolis Cat., no. 630). Older writers were inclined to consider the head masculine. The date is somewhat earlier than the middle of the sixth century and the head appears to be not Attic, but northern Ionic, of the school of Chios.

Excavations at the findspot later in the 19th century revealed evidence for a sanctuary identified as one dedicated at one stage to Apollo (Ohnefalsch-Richter 1893, 10 no. 6; also Buncchol and Untiedt 1996, 46-7 and pls 61-63). According to the account of the discovery preserved in Ludwig Ross's account of his visit to Cyprus in 1845, the statue was naked, with the exception of a wide belt, with the left foot extending forward (Ross 1910). The arms, legs and head broke off as the statue was dragged away from the site, suggesting they were cast separately from the body. The existence of the belt suggests a more archaic form for the body than the head, whose closest parallels lie in the Severe Style of Greek sculpture in the second quarter of the 5th century BC.  
The staue was broken up and sold for scrap bronze for a very low price, with the exception of the head which came into the possession of the English collector and dealer Henry Borrell (then living in Smyrna) who later sold it on to the Duke of Devonshire. It remained at the latter's country residence at Chatsworth, Derbyshire until acquired by the British Museum in 1958 (though it had been on exhibition there at several points in the 20th century). Recent research on a large bronze leg in the Louvre has revealed that it also belong to this statue, confirming that the original figure was larger than life size (Bouquillon et al. 2006, with full refs).  
Cornelius Vermeule suggests the statue was a cult image similar to that from the temple of Apollo at Miletus and suggests that the intact statue held arrows or a phiale in one hand and a bow in the other (Vermeule 1976, 15-16 and pl. I, 1). This is not at all certain as there is no evidence from Ross's account for these features. Moreover cult statues of this kind are very rare on Cyprus, though some actual images of Apollo have been identified as early as the fifth century BC. The original statue may simply have been a monumental image of a votary, analagous to the many stone and terracotta examples known from Cypriot sanctuaries of CA and CC date, including those believed to have been influence by the Chatsworth head itself found at Tamassos, Idalion and elsewhere. 
The cultural origin of the head is debated, and both Greek and Cypriot artists have been suggested, especially given the influence it seems to have exercised on the local production of limestone statuary, though other Greek imports or Cypriot-made works could also have served as a model (Vermeule 1976, 15-16; Hermary in Bouquillon et al. 2003, esp. 257-61). Despite the Severe Style parallels, a local Cypriot imitation may be later in date to the Aegean prototype, though probably no later than the mid-fifth century BC.

This is a figure of a reclining naked man, made from a single piece of marble, who appears as if caught in the action of raising himself. He would have originally supported his weight on his left hand and is poised as if turning to his left. A piece of drapery hangs over his left arm and then flows on the ground behind him to rise over his right knee. The head, left hand, right arm and hand, part of his right leg and left foot are missing. These parts were already missing by the time of Carrey made a drawing in 1674. The figure was placed in the far left corner of the pediment, looking towards the centre. The pose and design of the statue fits well in the corner angle of the pediment. The back of the statue is finished in surprising detail, considering it would not have been seen once it was in place in the pediment. 
The statue is thought to represent the river-god Ilissos, a stream in Athens, shown as if rising from the water onto the riverbank. Other suggested identifications are other Athenenian streams, Eridanos and Kephisos.",Designed by: Pheidias,,,,,,Classical Greek,438BC-432BC,Made in: Athens,Excavated/Findspot: Parthenon,marble,,,,Height: 81.28 centimetres max ; Length: 188 centimetres; Depth: 56 centimetres,,,"Sculpture / Catalogue of Greek Sculpture in the British Museum; Smith 1892 / A Catalogue of Sculpture in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities, British Museum; Smith 1910 / The sculptures of the Parthenon; Brommer 1963 / Die Skulpturen der Parthenon-Giebel; Palagia 1993 / The pediments of the Parthenon; Choremi-Spetsieri 2004 / The Sculptures of the Parthenon: Acropolis, British Museum, Louvre",On display (G18),"Exhibited:

The period from about 700 BC to the Roman conquest witnessed a remarkable revival in Egyptian art, seemingly stimulated by the Nubian rulers who gained control of Egypt towards the end of the eighth century BC. One of the most influential factors in this revitalisation of art was the so-called 'archaising tendency', a harking back to the glories of what were regarded as the 'golden ages' of Egypt's past - the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms. The monuments of those periods were studied in detail and those qualities considered to be their finest were imitated in contemporary art, architecture, writing and religion. This was not done with any intention to deceive, but rather out of respect and admiration for the great achievements of the past, and out of a desire to identify the present more closely with those earlier epochs.
Nowhere is this tendency more apparent than in private sculpture. The statue of the priest Tjayasetimu (b), which would have been placed in a temple to enable the owner's spirit to partake of the offerings, is clearly copied from the tomb statues made for private individuals in the Old Kingdom. That of Nenkheftka from Deshasha (a), is an excellent example of such a figure. The sculptor of the late statue has copied both the stiff formal pose, with left foot advanced and arms held rigidly at the sides, and the simple costume, reproducing carefully the short curled wig, fashionable in the Old Kingdom but not usual in the Late Period. Archaising sculptures of the 25th and 26th Dynasties are sometimes such successful imitations of earlier works that dating would be difficult were it not for the inscriptions, which provide essential clues. Since there is no reason to suppose that the texts of the present statue were later additions, the name of the owner, Tjayasetimu - not attested before the Late Period - is a reliable guide, while among his titles is that of Priest of the statues of King Psammetichus I (664-610 BC), demonstrating that the figure cannot be dated earlier than the middle of the seventh century BC.

The man wears a costume comprising a short-sleeved round-necked shirt, a wraparound skirt and a fringed shawl, whose mid-section he grasps in his left hand; the object in his right fist has been identified as a folded cloth, a symbol of aristocracy since early dynastic times. The figure strides on the left foot with one hand clenched, the artistic convention since the beginning of the dynastic period for representing male dynamism and capability for action. As a priest, the owner has a shaven head. The back pillar, which is rounded at the top and reaches the back of the head, supports the figure and was an architecturally necessary support for standing statuary but with inherent symbolism.

Following his death in Canada in 1910, his executors sold the deposited material to the Trustees for £15 (see GR Trustees Reports, 3 May, 1910; information also in the GR Register for this group). A terracotta figurine, registered as 1910,6-20.22, was returned to the Cyprus Museum a few years later as it had been mistakenly sent to the British Museum with Warren's material. Not everything in the group purchased in 1910 was registered by the British Museum: the duplicate items from Tamassos donated to museum/college collections in the United Kingdom (in Aberystwyth, Dublin, Mullingar, Co.

Europa riding the bull-figure of Zeus
Babylon, Iraq
Possibly 1st century BC – 1st century AD
This is a scene from Classical mythology. Europa was said to be the daughter of a Phoenician king who was abducted by the Greek god Zeus who took the form of a bull. She was carried off to Crete and their sons were said to have included king Minos. The delicate colouring includes a blue veil, pink flesh, red base, and black on the borders of the veil and on the bull's head. This combination of colours and Classical mythology are clear evidence for Greek influence on local arts and crafts following the conquest by Alexander in the 3rd century BC. However, the frontal style of this object is non-Classical and the object therefore probably dates to the early Parthian period.

‘A sepulchral marble bearing a bas relief and a Greek inscription.  It is in the pyramidal form generally used for funeral monuments in Greece from whence it was brought to England by the late Doctor Antony Askew’ (TY 14/1/126). 
 
The extract from the inscription that is quoted in the Wigan accounts is enough to identify Smith 704 (1805,0703.258) as the stele bought at the Lyde Browne sale. Its identity with the ‘Greek sepulchral monument’ in Combe’s Supplementary List (TY 18/4, staircase 7) is not absolutely certain but seems very likely. The possibility seems to have occurred to FitzGerald, since in the slip catalogue on which his 1848 inventory is based there appears the comment ‘VI.91?’, which refers to the entry on this stele in the 1808 edition of the Synopsis.  
The form of the stele suggests Smyrna as a source (Smith; E. Pfuhl and H. Möbius, Die ostgriechische Grabreliefs, 2 vols. (Mainz am Rhein, 1977-1979)) and a date of about 150-100 BC (E. Pfuhl and H. Möbius, Die ostgriechische Grabreliefs, 2 vols. (Mainz am Rhein, 1977-1979)).
Formerly in the Meade collection. The comment in TY 14/1/126, that it was brought to England by Dr Antony Askew, may be an error, perhaps from confusion with the stele of Xanthippos (159).
Bought at the Lyde Browne sale for £5 (Wigan Accounts). 
Townley settled his account for two objects on 3 June: ‘Paid at the sale of Lyde Browne for front of a sarcophagus with genii £6.6s. and for a Greek sepulchral stone (Ο · ΔΗΜΟΣ) £5’ (Wigan Accounts).

The king is shown on the right side and wears the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. A fragmentary uraeus cobra is visible above his forehead, the head of the cobra now missing. His eyes are narrow with heavy ridges, and he has a short nose and small mouth. His face is soft and fleshy in appearance. The upper body of the king is bare, with soft modelling of the musculature of the chest and abdomen. He wears a short shendyt kilt, and his left leg advances forward ahead of the right. There are small traces of gilded detail across the body and crown, particularly at the chin, and in the folds of the arms and legs. 
The god Sobek is shown on the left side and wears the solar disc with a large uraeus cobra depicted in the lower half. Below this he wears a long smooth wig. The snout and teeth of the deity are visible, and clear traces of gilded detail are visible across his face. His upper body is bare with a plain broad collar worn around the neck. He wears a short kilt, holds his arms by his sides, and advances forward with the left leg mirroing the striding pose of the king.

The piece could be considered as a sculptor’s model or trial piece, used by the sculptor to practice or perfect their carving skills and as an aid to ensure the production of an even two or three-dimensional sculpture; however, this is perhaps less likely considering the small traces of surviving paint which suggest that the entire background behind both figures was originally painted blue, while both figures were gilded. There does not appear to be any inscription across the obverse, but it is possible that there was once an inscription across the now damaged reverse. The stone slants forward, thus the figures appear at a bent angle particular when viewing the objects from either side. 
The god Sobek had various cult centres within the Fayum and south in Upper Egypt, as well as the double temple of Kom Ombo in Aswan that was rebuilt by Ptolemy XIII and shared by both Sobek and the god Horus.

A community of ethnic Phoenicians existed in Piraeus from the 5th century BC, both from the Levant and from Kition in Cyprus. Their non-citzien status put them at a legal disadvantage in some ways, but they had wealth and some social status due to their commercial activities but also when Athens enjoyed good relations with their various Phoenician home communities. During the 4th centuy BC, Sidon and Athens became close allies, especially duing the reign of King Straton who adopted many Hellenic traits, from his new name to architectural and sculptural programmes within his kingdom. 
This tomstone probably dates to this period. Artemidoros was presumably wealthy or important enough to have a monumental gravestone and was probably an important merchant, foreign resident or visitor from Sidon during a period when the two cities enjoyed excellent political and commercial relations. It is not entirely certain if the Greek and Phoenician texts refer to the same person, though the Greek appears to be a rendering of the equivalent deity names invoked in the Phoenician. The stele might have been reused, though presumably by another member of the Sidonian community in Athens.

Before him is an offering stand stacked with slices of bread and surrounded by hieroglyphs for the invocation-of-offerings formula that will supply him with bread and beer, flesh and fowl, linen garments, incense and unguent in the afterlife. The hieroglyphs before his face supply his titles, name and parentage, and describe the ritual he carries out as 'adoring the god four times'. The deities depicted from left to right, all named and with lengthy epithets, are Osiris, Apis,  Isis, Nephthys, Horus, Anubis, Imhotep, deified architect of the first pyramid; and the falcon of the West. All of them grant Pasherenptah otherworldly blessings. The frame at the left is composed of the palm rib, the hieroglyph for 'a year', with Heh, god of millions, in characteristic pose at its base, the whole symbolically wishing the deceased millions of years in the afterlife. The frame at the right is the 'was'-sceptre. The fourteen rows of superbly carved hieroglyphs begin with a standard funerary offering formula on behalf of  Pasherenptah,  whose numerous titles are listed in full, and continue with a conventional address to the living. Then there follows a detailed autobiography.",,,,,,,Ptolemaic,41BC,Made in: Egypt (?),Found/Acquired: Saqqara (Memphis),limestone,,,incised,Height: 72.50 centimetres; Weight: 85 kilograms; Width: 61 centimetres; Depth: 14 centimetres,"Inscription type: inscription Inscription script: hieroglyphic Inscription translation: Titles/epithets include : High priest of Ptah Inscription note: Incised. Pasherenptah's autobiography describes how, immediately after his appointment as high priest of Ptah at the age of fourteen, he performed the coronation of Cleopatra's father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, in 76 BC in accordance with the ancient pharaonic rituals. When Pasherenptah went to Alexandria, the King stopped his chariot en route to the temple of Isis to show him personal favour by rewarding him with a gold chaplet and appointing him priest of the royal cult. The hieroglyph for 'ride in a chariot' occurring twice in line 10 is a particularly fine Ptolemaic example of the graphic nature of the script. Subsequently, Auletes and his family visited Memphis to take part in local festivals in which the High Priest undoubtedly played an important role. When Pasherenptah had reached the age of forty-three, he and his wife were still without a male child, but Imhotep answered their prayers and the son was named in the god's honour. The intercession of Imhotep presumably explains his appearance among the deities at the top of the stela: although after deification the architect of the first pyramid was made the son of Ptah and so had particular relevance for Ptah's priesthood, Paherenptah obviously looked upon him as a personal god. The High Priest's death took place in year 11 of Cleopatra VII, precisely on 14 July 41 BC, and it is of interest that the embalming process took eighty days rather than the seventy usually considered the optimum time. The inscription also provides the information that the text was composed by Pasherenptah's brother-in-law Horimhotep and carved by the deceased's own nephew Khahap.","Bibliography:

Like the southern branch of the procession, the northern branch comprises mounted horsemen, chariots, elders, musicians, pitcher-bearers, tray-bearers and figures leading sacrificial victims. As in the South frieze, so in the North the cavalcade comprised sixty riders. Whereas in the South these are carved over twenty-four blocks, in the North they are compressed into nineteen blocks.

The frieze shows the procession of the Panathenaic festival, the commemoration of the birthday of the goddess Athena.
The block shows a cow that is being led for sacrifice. Four youths are shown and the remains of two others on the extreme left and right, all wearing long cloaks. The youth on the left looks round to observe the commotion on the block behind him. At the same time he shortens the halter of the beast under his charge. A second youth reaches out to assist him and also looks back. Meanwhile the animal registers a protest by straining its neck upwards. The halter must have been added in paint. The flank of another beast is visible between the poorly preserved figure on the right and the youth looking back. This detail connects with the forepart of the animal that is carved on the next block, Block XLV. The head and dewlap of the beast on the next block, Block XLV, also connect well with the flank on this block. Further detail connecting Blocks XLIV and XLV is the line of the damaged arm of the youth on XLIV, which connects convincingly with the hand on XLV. (For argument see Jenkins, ‘The south frieze of the Parthenon: problems in arrangement’, American Journal of Archaeology, 99, p. 445-56). The broad, blank hides of the beasts contrast pleasingly with the complex folds of the drapery of the youths who lead them. 
This scene in the frieze is thought to have inspired the poet John Keats in his ‘Ode on a Grecian Urn’, to write of ‘the heifer lowing to the skies’.

Chest with reliefs on all four sides which originally surmounted a Lycian sepulchral tower. 
1. North side. In the centre a young armed man stands on the left offering a helmet to a bearded man seated on the right. The former wears sandals, greaves, short chiton with sleeves of crinkled material, the lower part in flat pleats with high zigzag edge, and cuirass with leathern flaps; at his left side is a short broad sword, the scabbard ending in a knob; in front of his chest projects a bird's head and neck, the sword-handle; it is higher than the scabbard, the blade being curved. The back of the head is broken away and the face is weathered. His left hand supports a large shield which stands on edge on the ground before him; with his right hand he extends a plumed Corinthian helmet to the seated figure, who raises his right hand to receive it. The latter wears sandals, sleeved Ionic chiton and mantle thrown over his back, left shoulder and knees. His right hand holds a spear or sceptre sloped against the left shoulder. He has a moustache and pointed beard, long nose and almond-shaped eyes, the inner angle curving, the upper lid prolonged in an incised line. The head is disproportionately large and is lost at the back. The outline of the hair is waved. The seat is a stool with turned legs, upon which is a cushion; underneath it is a small quadruped with thick body, short legs, and pointed snout lowered to the ground to left, possibly a bear (the identification by some writers as a pig is wrong, as the animal has paws).
On the angle-slabs, facing outwards, are the figures formerly known as Harpies, but which are now identified as Sirens. They have the head, breasts and arms of women; the body ends like an egg, with a bird's spreading tail and talons attached. Long wings spring from the shoulders and under the arms; the ends are continued on the centre slab. The figures are shown as nude save that on the elbows are the crinkled sleeves of chitons. The hair is worked in small waves and confined by a pointed diadem; it falls in long tresses on the left figure, and is looped up at the back on the right. Their features wear a soft smile, as they fly off carrying diminutive female figures in their arms clasped against their breasts by both hands and talons. The latter wear long crinkled chitons with sleeves and long overfolds; the feet are bare, their hair is long and falls loosely; on the right, the hair is waved, with a diadem; on the left it is treated as a plane with horizontal grooves. Each raises the inner hand to the chin of the Harpy, the outer hand hangs down; the one on the right holds in the hanging hand an object now broken, perhaps a patera.
On the extreme right in the corner squats a diminutive woman in an attitude of grief, her chin resting on both hands, her head turned upwards towards the siren.   She wears a long crinkled chiton with large loose sleeves and a diadem on her hair, which hangs loose at the back. The mouth and front edge of forearms and legs are broken away.
2. South side. The angle-slabs are practically replicas of those on the North side; in each is a Siren carrying off a female. On the left slab the hair of the Siren is looped up-behind, two, short curls falling in front of the ear; the female raises its right hand, while the left arm hangs limply; it is clasped more tightly than the other. On the right slab the woman raises both hands, and the hair of the Siren falls in long plaits. Both women have waved hair with diadems. The right bottom corner of the left angle slab is missing; there is no seated mourner.
The central group consists of a man enthroned on the left, before whom stands a figure of uncertain sex. The seated man is beardless, with full features and heavy forms; he wears Ionic chiton, mantle over the left shoulder, and shoes with turned-up toes, and is seated on a throne with turned legs, cushion and high back. A spear, or sceptre, leans against his left shoulder. His hands are extended before him, the right holding an apple, the left holding aloft a pomegranate. The back of his head and the back leg of the throne are missing. The head and shoulders of the standing figure are broken off, but the outline of the nose and chin, which was beardless, may be traced on the slab; it has generally been interpreted as male; the left hand holds a fluttering dove in front by the wing, the right hand is raised with fingers extended in an attitude of adoration; the dress consists of Ionic chiton, mantle and sandals.
3. East side. This side has suffered most from weathering. The central group consists of a bearded man enthroned on the left to whom a youth brings offerings. The throne has legs terminating in animal's feet, a high sloping back, a brace and a handrail supported by a small Triton who is extended with body to front and bearded head to right, the hands outstretched as supporters; a cushion is indicated. The details of the man's face are weathered; he has a long pointed beard, and wears Ionic chiton and mantle, the end of the latter falling over the back of the chair; his feet, which seem to be bare, rest on a cushion the front of which, with the toes, is broken away, as is also the back leg of the chair. His left hand rests on the staff of a spear or sceptre his right holds a poppy (?) before his face. Before him is a diminutive draped boy, holding out to him a cock held in the right hand, and in the left a fruit. The lower part of this figure is missing; it may have been shown as kneeling.
On the left angle slab two draped figures advance towards the centre, both wearing Ionic chitons and mantles; the first has sandals, the second is barefoot. The first holds a pomegranate suspended from the left hand and in the right holds up a flower (?). The second draws up an edge of the mantle with the left hand, and with the right raises a poppy-head (?) to the face. The sex of these two persons has been much disputed; the pose of the hands, the attributes and the arrangement of the drapery compare with the women on the West side; on the other hand, the contours are indefinite, and therefore probably male; the hair is short like the man on the right angle slab, and the second of the two appears to have a short pointed beard; this figure is remarkably corpulent.
On the right angle slab, a youth advances towards the centre. His feet are broken away; on his farther side is a dog looking up at him, its tail on the right edge of the slab. He wears Ionic chiton and mantle over the left shoulder and his hair is short at the back. He holds a stick with a curved handle in his left hand; his right hand holds up an object, which is broken away save for a handle underneath his fingers, but which was in part of metal separately attached, for which the rivet hole remains; it may have been a cup on a tall stem. The feet are missing.
All the persons on this side, save the boy in the centre, had metal circlets about their hair; the rivet holes remain at the back of the heads.
4. West side. In each angle slab an enthroned woman faces the centre. The woman on the left has a broad pointed diadem round her hair, which is waved over the forehead and tied in a knot behind, the ends falling on her shoulders. She wears Ionic chiton with long full sleeves down which runs a broad flat seam-strip, and a mantle over the left shoulder and knees; the end of the chiton falls like a bird's wing under the seat; on her wrists are bracelets. Her right hand is extended holding a libation-bowl on her knee; her left was raised holding some object which is now broken away. On her feet are shoes with upturned toes; she is seated on a throne with high back (the top broken), turned legs, a handrail supported by a seated sphinx to right and ending in a ram's head, cushion and footstool (a fragment rejoined and the right side missing). The footstool is in one piece with the throne, as on the Branchidae statues.
The woman on the right is similar save that the hair is looped up; in her left hand she holds out a pomegranate, with her right she raises a poppy flower to her face. Her throne is of different design; the back is curved and ends in swan's head; there is no Sphinx under the handrail, which ends in a ram's head; the legs are rectangular with volute indents and terminate above in volutes. The left bottom corner of the footstool is missing; it is thicker than the other and independent of the throne.
On the centre slab, three women move to right in procession towards the right seated figure. They are similar save in the attitude of the hands, and have diadems round the hair, which falls on back and breast in long tresses, Ionic sleeved chitons and mantles, the ends of which fall at the side on the first figure, down back and front on the other two. The first two have shoes with turned-up toes, the feet and legs below knees of the third are broken away, save for one bare toe. The first draws the side of her mantle in front of her face with the left hand and supports a fold in front of her hips with the right. The second holds a pomegranate in front of her with the right, while the left raises a poppy to her nose. The third holds up an egg before her face, while the left holds up the drapery. All wear bracelets.
On the left the centre slab is prolonged above to form a lintel for the door, and the left angle slab is correspondingly cut back over the libation-bowl of the left seated figure to receive it. Above the door is a flat moulding and above this a relief of a cow to left suckling a calf.
The shaft was of limestone, the reliefs of large-grained marble, now weathered; they are made up of central slabs and angle-pieces. The subjects are set in a frame; at the sides and at the top is a flat moulding, curving below into the relief-ground and projecting 0.023m; the relief of the figures occasionally projects beyond it. At the bottom is a straight base-line below which is a cyma recta. 
The north, south and east sides are similar in composition; in the central slab a seated figure receives offerings, while angle-pieces are filled by subsidiary figures. The western side contained the entrance to the chamber and shows seated figures in the angle-pieces and a procession in the centre, with an independent relief in the space over the door.
The reliefs are worked with elaboration of detail, fleshy smiling faces and soft draperies that reveal the contours. The west side is not only the best preserved and most important, but is superior in style; the proportions are better, the scale smaller, the heads being kept below the moulding. On the North and East (and possibly the South) sides, all heads cut into the moulding, except the Siren groups which, however, extend over the side border, as if to emphasise the idea of departure. On these three sides the figures are thick and clumsy.
The hair is, with one exception, delicately worked in rows of waved lines, cut short on the neck for the men, loose or looped up on the women. The eye shows a raised eyeball and raised lashes, the inner angle sometimes blunted. The drapery is carefully finished; on the chitons of the children the crinkling is convex, on the other figures it is worked in narrow concave bands. The wider folds of the mantles are also curved. The lower edges of the sleeves are formally drawn forward.",,,,,,,Classical Greek; Achaemenid,480BC-470BC,Made in: Lycia,Excavated/Findspot: Xanthus,marble,,,,"Height: 102.50 centimetres approx, siren relief slab ; Height: 53 millimetres door ; Length: 127 centimetres East, centre slab ; Length: 60 centimetres East, r. and l. angle slabs ; Length: 108 centimetres North, centre slab ; Length: 61 centimetres North, r. and l. angle slabs ; Length: 108 centimetres South, centre slab ; Length: 61 centimetres South, r. and l. angle slabs ; Length: 86 centimetres West, centre slab ; Length: 41 centimetres West, door ; Length: 57 centimetres West, l. angle slab ; Length: 61 centimetres West, r. angle slab ; Length: 245 centimetres West, whole ",,"BM Sculpture
The monument, which is commonly known as the 'Harpy Tomb,' was discovered by Fellows among the ruins of Xanthus, adjoining the theatre, on April 19th, 1838, and was described by him in the following terms: 'The Harpy Tomb consisted of a square shaft in one block, weighing about eighty tons, its height seventeen feet, placed upon a base rising on one side six feet from the ground, on the other but little above the present level of the earth. Around the sides of the top of the shaft were ranged the bas-reliefs in white marble about three feet three inches high; upon these rested a capstone, apparently a series of stones, one projecting over the other; but these are cut in one block, probably fifteen to twenty tons in weight. Within the top of the shaft was hollowed out a chamber, which, with the bas-reliefs sides, was seven feet six inches high, and seven feet square. This singular chamber had been probably in the early ages of Christianity the cell of an anchoret, perhaps a disciple of Simon Stylites. . . . The traces of the religious paintings and monograms of this holy man still remain upon the backs of the marble of the bas-reliefs.’ (Marbles, p. 21).
See also Fellows, Journal, p. 231, pl. opp. p. 232; Account, p. 170, and pl.; Travels, pp. 172, 438, 490 and 493; and cf. Birch in Archaeologia, XXX, p. 186: ‘the interior has some crosses and a scroll or book, much effaced, on which is ME [γας θέος?] ... the interior of this chamber represented woodwork with its beams and sunken soffits, and an ancient door still exists, under the cow suckling its calf.’ Little of this painting can now be traced.
A drawing by Scharf in the Departmental Library shows the monument as discovered; for another view in the original state see Mon. Ined. d. Inst., IV, pl. 2, reproduced in Rayet, Mon. de l’Art Ant., I, V, p. 3. Fellows removed the reliefs by building up a support for the capstone within the chamber; the present appearance of the tower is shown in Benndorf, Reisen in Lykien, I, pl. 26.
South side: The interpretation of the seated figure as a man is traditional, but the upturned shoes and gesture of the hands as well as the attributes they hold recall the women of the West side. If it were certain that the figures on the left of the East side were female, this seated figure would have to be accepted as a woman, as the ambiguous contour of its breast is similar; it is, however, most probable that the East side figures are men.
Colouring. 
The ground of the reliefs was bright blue, which remains round the head and left hand of the youth on the right angle slab of the East side. A. H. Smith also detected this under the wrist of the first figure behind the throne 
on this side (Catalogue, 1892, p. 57). Birch saw scarlet on the crest of the helmet on the North side (Archaeologia, XXX, p. 192); Scharf observed traces of red in the hollow of the shields and upon sandals (Mus. of Class. Antiq., I, p. 252); while the tint can no longer be stated, patches of faded pigment are still to be seen in the soles of sandals. Elsewhere a stain on the marble indicates the former presence of paint. Considerable remains of this may be observed on the left angle slab of the North side, above the head, on the body between arms and talons and below the body of the ‘Harpy’. A palmette scroll is clearly visible in silhouette between the bars of the throne on the East side. A. H. Smith (l.c.) saw palmettes on the right throne of the West side, which are now hard to trace; but cushion and interspace of the left throne of the same side show clear traces of patterns, probably similar palmettes, while the side shows remains of incised guide-lines for maeander. There was a maeander on the top border and an egg and dart on the bottom curved moulding. The metal attachments on the East side have been noted above.
Interpretations. 
The earliest interpretation of the subjects was suggested by the sculptor Benjamin Gibson and adopted by Fellows, and other early commentators (see Fellows, Account, p. 171; Birch in Archaeologia, p. 171; Panofka in Arch. Zeit., 1843, p. 49). This identification, as the rape of the daughters of Pandareos, King of Lycia, by the Harpies (Odyssey, xx, 66) has been generally discarded; it does not explain at all the central groups, which are of prime significance, and it is now agreed that the winged corner figures do not represent Harpies (Furtwangler in Arch. Zeit., 1882, p. 204-Weicker, Seelenvogel, p. 32, n. 3).
A second group of theories sees in the enthroned figures deities of the underworld to whom the souls of the dead pay reverence. On the west side are Demeter and Persephone and three worshippers who carry symbols of life and birth, as the egg and the pomegranate. The door of the tomb indicates death, as the cow and calf above suggest renewal of life. The figures on the other sides are variously interpreted: Zeus (south), Poseidon (east) and Hades (north) by Braun (Ann. d. Inst., 1844, p. 151); Zeus in his triple aspect by Curtius (Arch. Zeit., 1855, p. 10 and 1869, p. 10); Hades (east), Minos (north), and Rhadamanthos (south) by Tonks (A.J.A., 1907, p. 334); A. H. Smith (Cat., p. 59) suggests unknown Lycian deities; Picard a Lycian under the triple aspects of master of heaven, sea and underworld (Sculpt, ant., p. 300). The objection to this method of explanation is that deities are not represented on grave-reliefs elsewhere in Greece and that, given the purely Hellenic workmanship of the relief, an interpretation within the Greek cycle of ideas seems most probable.
Most recent commentators, beginning with Milchhoefer (Arch. Zeit., 1881, p. 53), incline to the view that the seated figures are not deities but heroified persons buried in the tomb to whom the members of the family bring offerings. This view not only avoids the difficulty of the former explanation, but is supported by the analogy of other works, the series of early hero-reliefs from Sparta (Wace, Sparta Cat., pp. 102 ff.) being especially adduced for comparison. In these we have seated figures, sometimes singly, sometimes in pairs, receiving gifts from adorants or holding a cup for libation; the offerings of the cock, the flower, the pomegranate and other details find exact parallels on these Spartan reliefs.
That the principal or western side should be assigned to the women is explained by Loewy with reference to the matriarchal form of Lycian society (Mélanges Perrot, p. 223, and cf. Herodotus, i, 173). The other three sides, which resemble each other more closely, reveal a gradation of age and importance of the seated figures; the eastern shows an old  man with a long beard, the northern a man with a short beard, the southern a beardless youth (Brunn, Münchener Sitzungsb., 1872, p. 523); that three generations are intended seems likely, the aim of the sculptor being to express a continuity of cult at the communal family tomb.

The main decoration on this large and elaborate volute krater is a rare image of an episode from the Trojan War: the sacrifice of the young Greek girl Iphigeneia. The episode is set at the very beginning of the war. The Greek fleet is held at Aulis by bad weather sent by Artemis, because the fleet’s commander, king Agamemnon of Mykenai, had offended the goddess by killing a stag in her sacred precinct. The seer Kalchas pronounces that the only way to placate the goddess and to set off for Troia is for Agamemnon to sacrifice his own daughter, Iphigeneia, to Artemis. The scene on the krater shows the very moment that the sacrifice takes an unexpected dramatic turn.
The scene is played out on several levels, having been painted at a time when multi-register compositions were beginning to become common in Apulian pottery. In the centre is a white altar on two steps, with details painted in gold-brown. Behind it stands Agamemnon (more likely than Kalchas) to the right, his face turned to the front; he is bearded, with a himation slung around his hips and left arm, and holds a sceptre; in his right hand is the sacrificial knife with which he is about to slay Iphigeneia, who stands before him. Having been summoned under the pretence that she is to wed Achilleus, she appears to have accepted her fate; she looks downwards, with dishevelled hair, wearing a long peplos and bracelets. However, already a miraculous event is taking place: Iphigeneia is seemingly being transformed into a deer. Behind her appear the head, legs, and hind parts of a deer, which the goddess Artemis at the last minute substitutes to take her place as a victim, while Iphigeneia herself is whisked off to the Taurians. This twist in the story is first attested in the later 5th century BC, when it was staged most famously in Euripides’ play Iphigeneia among the Taurians of 413 B.C.
Directly behind Iphigeneia, but on a higher level, is the goddess Artemis herself, looking down at her; she appears in her guise as a huntress, wearing a short belted chiton with crossbands, a chlamys fastened at the front, laced-up boots, and carrying a bow and two spears. Opposite her on the other side of the scene is the youthful god Apollon, seated on drapery on a rock to the left and looking back at his sister, a laurel-branch in his right hand. Below him, to the left of the altar, a young man dressed in a himation – Achilleus or merely a sacrificial assistant – is assisting Agamemnon with the sacrifice. He leans forward with his left foot raised on a rock while holding a purple oinochoe and a tray of branches and grain. Behind him, on the extreme left, a female figure (Iphigeneia’s mother Klytaimnestra?) stands to the right with her hair in a knot, wearing a long dress and himation, raising her hand to her face. Above the altar two white bukrania (bull’s skulls) further emphasise the sacrificial context of the scene.
On the other side of the vase a youth is seated on drapery to the right, wearing a white fillet, and holding two spears in his left hand; facing him is a woman who stands raises a phiale in her right hand. The scene is framed by a youth with a staff on the right and a woman with a mirror on the left. 
Comments – Selected bibliography
The story of Iphigeneia is a classic version of the archetypal dilemma of having to sacrifice what is most dear as the only way out of a difficult situation, recalling especially the biblical story of Isaac’s sacrifice by his father Abraham, in which the son is also replaced in the last moment by a ram. First attested in literature in the post-Homeric epic Kypria, the sacrifice of Iphigeneia appeared in Greek art perhaps as early as the 7th century BC. The theme of the substitution is later and is rarely shown, but was taken up in a Hellenistic sculpture group. Given that Euripides’ plays in particular provided much inspiration for 4th century BC South Italian vase-painting, it is possible that the scene on this krater reflects theatrical renderings of Iphigeneia’s story. 
The primary reason for the choice of the theme, however, was presumably  the likely function of the vase as part of the funeral feast and its placement in a chamber tomb. This funerary aspect also shows in other aspects of the vase’s decoration, notably the confronted griffins flanking a central palmette on the neck, as well as the handles terminating in swans’ heads and featuring Gorgoneia in the volutes. The image of Iphigeneia’s heroic sacrifice and her divine rescue would have conveyed above all a message of hope that death might not be the end. This is a theme that is echoed also on many other vases for the tomb from Southern Italy, where Orphic and Bacchic mysteries provided popular paradigms for belief in regeneration, rebirth and a blissful afterlife.
