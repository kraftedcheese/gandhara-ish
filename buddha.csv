The damaged right hand was presumably in abhaya, while the left holds a water pot. He has long hair crowned by a large chignon drawn in by a band at its base, a collar, necklace and earrings. The face is oval and full, the eyes are a little narrow with distinct lids. The seat has legs with claws at the foot and drapery in between with pendent folds and gathered at the sides. A plain little footstool is below.

His face is long, the chin a little pointed, the eyes rounded and prominent. On the Bodhisattva's left the standing figure with hands cupped and joined as if holding something, wearing a turban with a globular ornament in the crest, earrings, collar and necklace, uttarīya and paridhāna, appears to be Indra. On the Bodhisattva's far right a damaged standing male figure, whose feet appear shod, wears the uttarīya in the wide mode, earrings, a large chignon on the back of his head and an offering in his cupped left hand with bracelet; the right arm is almost lost.

Among the groups with a Bodhisattva flanked by Brahmā and Indra or other figures he sees as representing the Instigation (saṃcodana) of Siddhārtha to abandon the secular life, Foucher specifies this panel as an example, explaining the water pot as symbolising the Bodhisattva's spiritual intentions, although it does not occur on all the examples he proposes for this subject. Framed representations of a Bodhisattva with water pot are indeed found associated with narrative scenes from the Buddha's life but not in unambiguous sequences to confirm an identification.; Zwalf 1996:

We ought to give to all.  Food ought to be give to the laborers who are virtuous. Three-fold gain should be given to the speaker of truth.  Place is not to be give to the disputer of Buddhism.  Two-fold gain should be given to the teacher of religion. To the good king tribute must be paid monthly with flowers and perfumes, and on the full mooon in the month Vaishakha he ought in particular to be presented with the jar.  My virtue and that of my ancestors is for the salvation of murderers of husbands, murderers of fathers, and murderers of friends, and of those who have committed great sins against the gods and brahmans. The kings that do not regard this kingdom preserving religion of Buddha, shall by it be cut off with all their family and perish in a flaming fire.

Translation
A bound goat, lying to the right, with very long horns, carved out excellently and finished from a dark, translucent layer of the most beautiful and bright Indian onyx, adhering to a white opaque one elsewhere, in a most ancient work, using a hammer and scalpel, not a borer and a wheel; nevertheless so skilfully and elegantly, that Greek artists even of the best periods scarcely ever fashioned anything more genuine, beautiful, or excellent. Bridled and bound horses and bulls are known on Cretan coins and those of King Archelaus of Macedonia; and a type of goat not different to this, which has been represented on the silver coins of [text unclear]; thus I thought the work to be very ancient Greek Asiatic. Nevertheless there are those who believed rather that it was from the Indus Valley civilisation; the empire of whom, as holy as civic, was thus overthrown completely by the Brahmins, around the six hundredth year before the birth of Christ, so that we have received only few and not sufficiently certain things about this from the richly mythical traditions of each people. However, remains and fragments among the ruins of the ancient cities, that have been dug up in many places, and preserved until now, demonstrate satisfactorily enough that it was very extensive and flourishing; and more productive and more distinguished by far in terms of the cultivation of the fine arts and taste, than the empire of those who succeeded them after they had been overthrown*; nor is it unreasonable to infer that statuettes made by the art of carving out hard and precious stones of this kind, reached the Greeks from this people; with specimens and material reaching them through trade with Medes and Persians, the borders of whom used to touch those of the Indian Empire: certainly the ancient Egyptians seem never to have been versed at all in the art either of carving out or of engraving these stones; nor do the Greeks seem to have practised this before the times of the Medes, although they were by no means ignorant of the latter even in the century of [text unclear]; indigenous stones certainly provide suitable evidence of this; yet Indian, bicoloured stone were generally needed for the former; and all more ancient examples have been carved or rather hammered out, in the practice still thriving among the Indians and Persians, with tools that are undoubtedly more incomplete than a hammer and scalpel, without a wheel and borer, and have then been finished with great care. What the Phoenicians accomplished in this art form we are not able to comprehend in any way, even through a probable inference; but that they practised it must scarcely be doubted.

At Amarāvatī carved slabs covered the 'stūpa' drum along the processional path where worshippers could see events from the Buddha's life and representations of the 'stūpa' itself. This drum slab shows the 'stūpa' in an elaborate form. The railing pierced by an entrance surmounted by lions obscures all but the tops of the drum slabs. The first visible register represents the drum coping; a rectangular projection with pillars occurs at the cardinal points. Two are visible at the sides with lions on the corresponding gateways. Above the drum coping are huge dome panels with crowded scenes. In fact, the drum platform projected 3.7m around the dome; no stairway is depicted and none was revealed in the excavations. Above the dome panels are registers with running animals, pots of plenty and undulating garlands which mark the beginning of the curvature; above are narrative roundels set in elaborate swags. Crowning the monument, a rectangular railing encloses a pillar and parasols. All the space beside it is filled by a dense composition of jubilant deities, one of whom is playing the flute. The scene visible in the gateway represents the Buddha, after the Enlightenment, sheltered from a storm by the serpent-spirit Mucalinda. Before him are worshippers; others flanking the gate include standing, sitting and dwarfish figures carrying offerings. The sheltering of the Buddha by Mucalinda was a little-used motif in India but became popular in Southeast Asia. There is no evidence, however, for images or panels of this apparent size below the pillared platforms, whose function is obscure. The railing of the processional path consists of uprights, a coping and crossbars with prominent lotus roundels, and projecting on both sides of the gateway are the tops of pillars standing in the processional path.
However inaccurate it may be in minor or even major features, this slab shows the splendour of an eastern Deccani 'stūpa' at its most ornate.; Bibliography:

According to the inscription on the base, it was dedicated to the Chongguang Temple 崇光寺 in Hancui village 韓崔村 in AD585. Both the temple and the village can no longer be identified, but it is thought that the location was south-west of Baoding 保定 in Hebei province, a region known for its white marble sculptures. 
Buddhism was slowly introduced into China from first century AD and was widespread during the period of division from second to sixth century AD. After achieving the reunification of much of China by AD 581, the two emperors of the Sui dynasty (AD 581-618), both devout Buddhists, made Buddhism a state religion. Amitābha, literally meaning boundless light in Sanskrit, is the principal Buddha of the Pure Land sect 淨土宗 popular in China in the sixth to seventh centuries. 
Almost 8m high, this statue is comparable in size with figures carved in the rock at the Buddhist cave temples of central China from the 5th-7th centuries. During this period, Chinese Buddhist sculpture underwent a transition in style. The earliest stylised images gave way to a greater naturalism, characterised with anatomically credible bodies, probably influenced by the art of Gupta India.
The hands of the statue are missing but the right hand would have been 		raised, palm outwards in the gesture of fearlessness (abhaya mudrā),  and 		the left hand lowered in the gesture of wish-granting (varada mudrā).
A joint and a polished work surface at the waist show that the statue was carved in two separate parts. 
Traces of pigments on more than one location on the surface suggest that the statue was once covered with gilding and colours. 
Buddhist figures often sit or stand on a lotus. Lotuses, as symbols  of purity, enlightenment and divine birth, are an important image in  Buddhist art.
This statue was originally flanked by two smaller figures of bodhisattvas (enlightening beings), one of which is now in the Tokyo National Museum.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Rawson 1992 / The British Museum Book of Chinese Art; Pemberton 2002 / The Buddha; Michaelson & Portal 2006 / Chinese Art in Detail; Howard et al. 2006 / Chinese Sculpture,On display (North Stairs),"Exhibited:

This, the oldest Nepalese image in the British Museum, is executed in the Gupta tradition that was well represented in the Nepal valley, but the treatment of mass is more summary in ways that recall developments in Bihar during the pre-Pala period (c.

From Whitfield 1985:
The great stupa at Rawak was one of the most important sites investigated by Stein on his first journey. Lying to the north of Khotan, high sand dunes helped to preserve it while subsoil water had destroyed the timbers that served to support its sculptures. The plan (see Ancient Khotan, Pl.XL) shows a vihāra court 161 feet (49.1 m)long by 141 feet (43.0m)wide, within which rose a stupa in three storeys, the lowest some 78 feet (23.8m)square. The stupa was approached by a staircase in the centre of each side; its summit, as measured by Stein, was some 23 1/2 feet (7.1m) above the floor of the court. The enclosing wall of this vihāra court was adorned, both inside and outside, with rows of colossal statues in clay stucco, supported on a wooden framework, which had completely disappeared. 
Because of the friable nature of the material, it was not possible for Stein to recover any of the larger figures intact: “All that could be done in the case of these large sculptures was to bury them again safely in the sand after they had been photographed and described” (Ancient Khotan, Vol.Ⅰ, p.502). The stupa and some of the very numerous statues lining the inner and outer walls of the stupa court are shown in Ancient Khotan (Figs.59-69), and other photographs from Emil Trinkler’s investigation of the site in 1927-28  are published by Gerd Gropp (1974, Figs.93-111 and Pls.XIII-XVIII). All of these show the magnificent scale of the whole sculptural arrangement, with larger than life-size standing figures of the Buddha alternating with smaller Buddha and Bodhisattva figures, some of them seated. The relatively small areas of wall in between the large relief figures were plastered and bore wall paintings of smaller figures, some of these probably being later additions (see Ancient Khotan, Vol.Ⅰ, p.492). 
The head shown here is from R. vi, one of the smaller Buddha figures on the inner south-west wall, standing between colossal Buddhas: the figure was broken by the fall of one of these(R. v, shown in Ancient Khotan, Fig.61) after it had been exposed for a day, but the head had been removed first and so survived. According to Stein, it was“in respect of pose, size and drapery a replica of the Buddha image R. ii. ”This figure, also visible in Fig.61 and, with its head in place, in Fig.69 of Ancient Khotan, was described by Stein in some detail (ibid., Vol. Ⅰ, pp.490-91). The form of the body is clearly visible, very narrow waisted and with swelling hips, beneath the drapery. As in the Gupta style, the drapery runs in raised lines over the smooth forms underneath, but here the lines are close-set and form stylised waves running down the figure from the neck-line. Behind the head, the nimbus was arranged in similar fashion to those reproduced by Gropp (1974, Figs.101, 103, 110) with a border of large overlapping spiral cloud scrolls, and a pointed flame extension at the top. Small seated appliqué figures of the Buddha, one at the top and two more on each side of the head, were set within the nimbus. The small appliqué seated Buddha in Pl.65 was intended for such a purpose, and is very similar, though it came from a different statue, R.lxxxiv. 
Although small in size compared with the largest figures, this head displays their principal characteristics. The whole face below the hairline is modelled in smooth curves, with very slight transitions between planes: in profile the eyebrows mark such a shift with little more than an incised line, and the small chin protrudes only slightly from the surrounding area. The eyes are sharply defined and are additionally modelled by a thick white application of stucco along the edges of the upper and lower lids. Little evidence remains of the original whitewash which probably covered the figure. Stein was able to describe a pink tīkā in the centre of the forehead, now difficult to distinguish. At the back of the head, a rectangular hollow almost the full width of the head marks the size of the supporting member of the timber framework behind the figure.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
熱瓦克塔是斯坦因第一次考古探險時發現的非常重要的遺跡之一。遺跡位於和闐北部，由於地下水的緣故支撐雕像群的木材已經腐蝕，然而厚厚的沙丘使它保存至今。據平面圖（參照《古代和闐》圖XL），寺址是49.1×43.0m的長方形，中央建有三層方塔，塔基邊長約23.8m。塔的各面中央設有臺階，據斯坦因測量，離地面約7.1m高。寺址四周圍牆的內外兩側都塑有聖像，莊嚴肅穆。最初支撐著的木架現在完全散落。
這些聖像質地脆弱易壞，斯坦因不可能完整地帶走較大的塑像。他說“我們拍照攝影和調查記錄工作結束後，只能把這些大塑像安全地埋回沙漠了”（《古代和闐》，卷1，502頁）。有關該塔和寺址圍牆內外側的塑像，除了《古代和闐》（圖59～69）外，Gerd Gropp出版的1927～1928年Emil Trinkler在此遺跡進行調查時所拍照片（《中國新疆•和闐考古發現》，1974，圖93～111及圖XIII-XVIII）中也有收錄。由此可瞭解造像規模之大，其中有比人高的立佛像，也有小一點的佛及菩薩塑像，有些是坐著的。在大佛像之間極狹窄的壁面上，塗上灰泥，繪有小的圖像，但其中有不少是後來加上的（見《古代和闐》，卷1，492頁）。
本圖所示的佛像頭部，是西南壁內側巨像間站立的一小佛像的頭部（R.vi）。此像因一身巨佛像的癱倒而毀壞（R.v，見《古代和闐》，圖61），由於風吹日曬，致使頭部與軀幹分離而殘存下來。依據斯坦因的說法，此像從“姿態、尺寸和衣紋等方面看，是R.vii佛像的複製品”。《古代和闐》的插圖61和69可以看到該像的全貌，斯坦因也作了詳細的記述（參照同書的490～491頁）。通過衣紋可清楚看到其體型為細腰肥臀Gupta風格的佛像。衣紋的線條隆起，柔順地覆蓋著身體，各個線條的間隔狹窄，形成波浪狀，從領口順著身體往下垂。頭部後面與Gropp（《中國新疆•和闐考古學發現》，1974，圖101，103，110）的形式一樣，旋渦狀的雲紋重合在大型帶狀紋的寶珠形項光上。在頭頂上和頭的兩側各貼一身小化佛。圖65的小佛就和這個小化佛一樣，儘管來自不同的塑像R.lxxxiv。
雖然尺寸與大的造像相比要少得多，但此像頭部也展示了其主要特徵。臉部前額的髮際刻板地往下拉，五官只有極小的起伏。即使從側面看，也只有一些微小的變化，眉毛只是稍有塌陷的刻線，下巴比其他部位稍微突起。眼睛很大，很清楚，上下眼瞼合在一起，貼著厚厚的白色睫毛。當初大概所有佛像都用白灰塗飾過，現在幾乎沒有痕跡了。在斯坦因記錄中，額中央還有粉色的白毫，但現在卻無法辨清。從頭像背後幾乎與頭尺寸相等的長方形凹槽可以想像原先支撐雕像木架之大。; Zwalf 1985
The great ‘stūpa’ at Rawak, north of Khotan, was surrounded by a large ‘vihāra’ court, 49.1 m by 43m. Considerable parts of the enclosing wall, adorned with images on both its faces, were preserved beneath the sand. These figures, many of them colossal, were of unfired clay supported on a timber framework, which had rotted away, so that some of the smaller heads alone could be removed. The present head is from one of the smaller Buddhas standing between colossal Buddhas on the inner south-east wall. The body of a similar figure visible in Stein's photographs is narrow-waisted, with thin drapery in narrow raised lines, as in Gupta sculptures.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith",Not on display,,,buddha; 佛 (Chinese),Representation of: Buddha;  Representation of: 佛陀,,,,,,,,1907,"The 1907-11-11 group refers to objects from Stein's First Central Asian  Expedition, 1900-01.

An ūrṇā in relief is intact. The left ear hardly survives but the right car emerges from the curls and has a damaged, perhaps leonine earring with pendent beads. Behind it a grooved projection suggests drapery folds and round the neck is a groove.

On the sides of the turban but complete only on the right is a four-legged monster with a long, leaflike beard and wing; his long thin body curves upwards as on BM 1902.0520.4 and BM 1880.191 but is not held by a retaining band. Judging by the sides, which are carved as far as the roughly flat back, the head was turned to its left, but that side of the face, though flatter, is fully carved without notable asymmetry. A lack of finish, however, appears from details such as the plain upper retaining band and border around the crest, the more summarily carved and incomplete monster and less prominent curls below; the absence of the vertical loop of cloth with its prominent pleated end hanging below it as on the right side must be due to the angle of the head.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 9 centimetres; Height: 14 centimetres; Width: 10.40 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:

From Whitfield 1985:
Shrine xv of the Ming-oi shrines was “a plain cella about 12 feet square” and, like the other shrines, had suffered damage by fire; but in it Stein discovered both some fine pieces of wood carving (Pls. 114-15) and, among other examples of stucco reliefs, this large and beautiful Bodhisattva head. Like the small heads from Shrine xi, it has lost all trace of the original colouring in the fire that hardened it, but this has in no way impaired the fine modelling of the features and the cascading locks of hair. Seen next to the much smaller standing figures of devatas and similar pieces from the other shrines, the very scale of this head gives an idea of the size and richness of the whole ensemble, which must have included life-size or larger Buddha and Bodhisattva figures, as well as closely packed smaller figures.
In style and expression the head is close to the classical sculpture of Gandhara; in particular the half-closed eyes, like those of the Foucher Bodhisattva in the Musee Guimet, suggest meditation, and all of the other features are calm and regular.; Chinese

From Whitfield 1985:
This pair of devatas are among the most complete of the hundreds of figures found by Stein in the cella of a ruined temple at Ming-oi, not far from the one containing the wall paintings of the preceding plate. Stein dated them and most of the other stuccos from the site to the eighth century, on the basis of coins placed near the images, which were dated to the Dali (A.D. 766-79) and Jianzhong (A.D. 780-83) reigns (Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1194). In the museum’s own display, they were dated even later, as eighth-to tenth-century pieces. Had it not been for the presence of these coins, Stein would have dated the images considerably earlier, but he felt that the numismatic evidence was conclusive and that the earlier style of the figures could be sufficiently accounted for by the discovery of moulds, which could have continued in use for centuries.
    As we have just seen in Pl. 95, there is no doubt that the Ming-oi site, with its extensive group of temples, was still in use in the Uighur period, since the costumes of the donors from the wall paintings are unmistakable. But the use of wall paintings as the principal decoration in this temple suggests that there had been a shift away from moulded stucco decorations, as the two media are not easily combined. Besides, coins could have been deposited by worshippers for as long as the temple remained accessible, and while the roofs of the shrines remained intact. Even after the collapse of the roofs, many unfired figures survived with their colouring until the present time. These considerations may allow us to establish the date of the figures according to their style, which is still close to the art of Gandhara. A later style. Showing Chinese influence, can also be identified in the stucco figures of some of the shrines, such as the Bodhisattva head of Pl. 102.
    In composition too, to judge by the sheer numbers of figures and the way that they were closely packed together (some groups still in situ are illustrated in photographs taken by Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. Ⅲ-Ⅴ), the relief decoration of the Ming-oi temples must have been comparable to that of Gandhara. Plate 96 shows some of these features in a single devata. Moulding was used extensively to give such figures their perfection of expression, with smooth and regular features, and for the appliqué scarves and ornaments. The devata is broken off at the knees, but Fig. 140 allows us to see the proportions of the long and slender legs of a similar piece. All are built up of layers of clay applied to a core of reeds bound in a bundle, over which the moulded form fitted as a final layer. Fire has destroyed the reed core, leaving only the impression of this and its binding, and has totally removed the original colouring, but at the same time it has hardened the clay and ensured its survival. The scarf around the shoulders frames the figure and masks the join to the wall, as with the next figure. Changes in attitude were probably made by adjusting the still-moist impression as taken from the mould, as was certainly done with many of the small heads shown in Pls. 104-9.
    Some actual moulds for small parts of figures are in the Stein Collection. One, Mi. iv. 001 (Fig. 148), is for casting a small single seated figure of the Buddha, two curls of hair, and two zig-zag locks (Serindia, Vol. Ⅳ, Pl. CXXXVII). Far more spectacular are the moulds made for the whole upper body and head of comparatively large figures, which are among the finds made by Oldenburg at Kucha and are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. More than thirty moulds were found at Ming-oi by Grunwedel and Le Coq (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 192). These moulds, like the one just referred to in the Stein Collection, are of plaster of Paris.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
斯坦因於明屋遺址發現上圖壁畫的寺的附近的一個寺址中的室裏發現數百塑像，這兩身天部像是其中破損最輕的兩件。斯坦因把同一遺迹的大致相同的這些泥像都斷爲8世紀。那是因爲離像不遠的地方發現了大曆（766～779年）和建中（780～783年）的貨幣（參照《西域》卷3，1194頁）。而在大英博物館的展品說明中，把它們的年代往後推至8～10世紀。如果沒有貨幣，斯坦因大概還會認爲這些像的年代更早，貨幣成了決定性的作用。有關這些像延襲了早期表現風格這點，數百年延續使用下來的模型的發現，可作充分說明。
正如圖95所示，明屋遺址以及許多寺院群無疑在回鶻時期仍然使用，根據壁畫上供養人的衣裳就能一目了然。但壁畫作爲該佛寺的主要裝飾而存在，顯示了由泥塑造像向壁畫图樣的轉變。因爲把兩者融洽地組合，是件不容易的事情。另外，貨幣遺物可能是塑造泥像沒遭破壞寺院仍然運轉時信徒們捐獻的香資。特別是屋脊沒有損壞而完整保留下來的寺中，即使倒塌了但沒有失火，塑像直到現在還完全保留著色彩。綜合以上考慮，這些像的年代，以風格極接近犍陀羅美術作爲最主要根據來判斷更合適。時代越往後，越能見到中國的影響，如圖102的菩薩頭部等及若干寺院的泥像。
結構上，其實由衆多像構成以及它們的組成方式（奧登堡在遺迹現場拍攝的若干圖的照片已收錄於他1914年的報告裏）等方面，這些明屋遺迹的身雕裝飾可與犍陀羅身雕裝飾進行比較。圖96中展示了具備那幾處特點的天部像。連細部都廣泛使用模子，産生出光滑有規則的表現。再者，天衣和裝飾物等粘貼的裝飾也用模子。此像膝蓋以下已缺損，但從Fig. 140我們可以推測出此像的比例。
這些像是在捆緊的槁草芯上反復塗上塑土，其上再安裝用模子製作的外形造型。經過火災，槁草的芯燃盡，只剩形狀和捆綁的繩子痕迹，色彩也比當初有變化，但經過燃燒塑土變得很堅硬，耐保存。披在兩肩上的天衣，像畫框一樣圍著塑像，遮蓋了鄰像和牆壁間的接合部。姿勢和表情的變化，可能是從模子裏取出以後，在半乾狀態下調整的，從圖104～109中展示的若干小像頭部可以窺出其究竟。
斯坦因的收集品中，包括很多實際製作這些像細部使用的模子，有一個小佛坐像的模子（Mi.iv.001）、兩個卷髮的模子、兩個穗狀頭髮的模子（參照《西域》，卷4，圖版CXXXVII）等。另外，奧登堡在庫車收集到的遺物中，有製作大型像上半身和頭部使用的大模子，現陳列于艾爾米塔什美術館。格倫威德爾和勒柯克在明屋發現的模子也有30多個（參照“Grunwedel”， 1912，192頁）。在巴黎的石膏模子與現在所談的斯坦因收集品中的模子相同。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

In the second scene the Buddha, in abhaya, turns slightly towards a naked child with triśikha hairstyle who looks up at the Buddha and joins his hands, as does a larger and youthful, naked, half-length figure with a curled band of hair framing the face and a necklace beside him.

Sometimes up to two thousand were put on a single mound. Within tombs sacred treasures of swords, mirrors and jewels were buried.

Jar with two seated Buddha figures

This jar carries a very early Chinese representation of the Buddha on either side of the jar. Buddhism was introduced to China from India and by the first century AD was rapidly gaining popularity among the Chinese people who readily adapted the teachings of Buddha to sit alongside their own indigenous religions and philosophies. Stonewares made in this region of northern Zhejiang province are characterised by a dark clay body and thin yellowish-green glaze.  Potters achieved this glaze colour by using a mixture of wood ash and clay. They then fired these wares in ‘dragon kilns’ which were built following the natural undulating curves of the hillsides.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above.

Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese

正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。

這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d).

Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

Above him a half-length figure with a crested turban, necklace and an uttarīya looks down, while beside him, seen from the back, strides a younger figure with a chignon and hair curled at the neck, an uttarīya, a paridhāna, earrings and a bracelet, his head raised like the ascetic's and his movement emphasised by the relief of his rounded and asymmetrical buttocks under the clinging garment.
In the next scene a muscular and turbaned figure, wearing a paridhāna and an uttarīya perhaps tied round and hanging down from the waist, a bracelet, an earring and a collar, raises one hand to strike the barrel drum hanging from his left shoulder and further held below by his left hand as he turns to the Buddha. The taller Buddha stands almost frontally but with his damaged head towards the drummer, his left hand, now lost, was perhaps covered in the prominently and regularly ridged over-robe and his lost right hand originally no doubt performed the abhaya gesture.

group with drummer representing, with or without a gateway as he later thought, the Entry into Rājagṛha. In the legend episodes with the Kāśyapa ascetics and the visit to Rājagṛha occur close together soon after the Enlightenment. Foucher defines his Entry into Rājagṛha from the Pāli canon as the Buddha and his monks coming for a meal at the invitation of king Bimbisāra when Indra, as a young brāhmaṇa, much admired for his looks, led the way singing verses. A meeting with King Bimbisāra and another with Uruvilva Kāśyapa and the king's invitation to a meal are generally reported at this stage in versions of the legend but while there can also be mention of a messenger (Saṃghabhedavastu) there is none of a musical escort except in the Pāli.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, chipped and with soil incrustation.

The Buddha is here more frontal than in the preceding piece, his feet are covered and his right knee is flexed forward; his robe, over both shoulders and covering his left hand, has regular curving and rounded ridges for drapery folds. The wavy hair continues into the uṣṇīṣa. His face is long and oval; the lids of the closed eyes meet in a slit. Under his right hand is a full pillow with a bobble, the side of the mattress has an undulating groove and a textile hangs between the turned legs with a wide pleat in the middle.
In front of the couch a monk, perhaps Ānanda, his right shoulder bare, supports himself on the ground with one hand and stretches out the other. Beside him, turned almost in profile, an apparently meditating figure, presumably Subhadra, with wrapped head and both shoulders covered, corresponds to the seated frontal figure in the same position in BM 1889.0715.9. The monk at the head of the bed, Anuruddha, with a bare right shoulder, visible undergarment and concerned expression, the tonsure lacking a hairline, advances towards Ānanda and probably extended an undercut arm now missing; his left arm is flexed indistinctly with the hand to, or above, the shoulder. Beside him Vajrapāṇi, a grieving old man with a broad chest, raises one arm over and across his head, which is turned away from the Buddha. He wears a short paridhāna and his uttarīya knotted as a thick scarf over his thighs, and his legs are undercut. His face is distinctly, almost finely, featured and two rows of curls over his lined forehead cover an otherwise bald head. The faceted vajra in his left hand lies against his shoulder. Above Vajrapāṇi is a tree with evenly paired leaves on the narrow curving branches and above the monk a mourner, both arms raised and ornamented, notably with armlets beside the shoulder, and wearing a small chignon and an uttarīya, looks on in grief.
Behind the Buddha is a damaged figure on rather a larger scale than the others. He has a broad flat chest under a large damaged head with earrings and short curls dramatically thrown back; he brings his undercut arms, with armlets just beside the shoulders, together behind his head; his eyes are long, open and set above high cheek-bones. To his left two figures, ornamented and with uttarīya, one with a high crested turban, the other with arms folded and possibly a chignon over a short hairstyle with a curled border, appear to be in conversation; another figure, in particular relief, turbaned and ornamented and with a grief-stricken face, brings one hand to the side of his head. Behind them are damaged half-length figures. On the flowering tree with narrowing trunk the lower branches are undercut.
Below the tree two figures converse: a monk almost in profile, right shoulder bare and an undergarment visible above undercut legs, a small 'embonpoint' below a broken arm, faces another figure with his right hand lifted, an undergarment also visible but his over-robe, which leaves the right shoulder bare, covering the gently inclined head, the backthrow passing round the neck. In the figure with a draped head and usually a bundle of sticks and talking with a monk in scenes of the Death cycle Foucher supposed that an ascetic of the tridaṇḍa-carrying order had replaced, in announcing the Buddha's death to Mahākāśyapa, the naked ājīvika of the piece in the previous catalogue entry, but in certain scenes learning of the circumstances before meeting Mahākāśyapa.

This panel contrasts with BM 1899.0715.9 in detail and delicacy, rounded cutting, composition and proportions.
The damaged figure behind the Buddha is perhaps a deity; other instances of a mourner, of large and energetic appearance, are seen elsewhere and also behind the bed among the gesturing Mallas or deities. On Peshawar 2084 a central figure with similar gesture has whiskers and an unusual headdress (turban). On Lahore 1037 a prominent central figure is the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, but the corresponding figure on Peshawar 775 has a turban and an uttarīya.

The haloed central Buddha, head now missing, stands frontally with his over-robe covering both shoulders, the neckline curved and in higher relief, the drapery folds shown in regular ridges. His abhaya gesture is all but lost. He stands in the middle on a triple stair of two treads, the central stair facing the viewer, the two flanking at an angle with the risers sloping inwards. Beside the Buddha on the flanking stairs are Indra on his left and Brahmā, both with hands joined and in uttarīya and paridhāna, Indra with ornaments. Brahmā's hair is long under a chignon with a horizontal length of hair with one end looped and one hanging down onto the forehead. Beside him at ground level two similar figures of diminishing size, hands joined, share his simpler appearance; those occupying the upper part of the panel wear ornaments and one is about to throw flowers, another has a bag at the waist from which he prepares to extract flowers, and between them a small Vajrapāṇi with a chignon to one side holds a short vajra. Kneeling beneath Brahmā and beside the central stair a figure with a bare right shoulder, a long garment and hands joined must be the nun Utpalavarṇa. Indra, on the Buddha's left, joins his hands and wears an uttarīya looped in higher relief below the waist, a bracelet, a collar, earrings and a headdress which combines a turban of cross-hatched pattern with a cylindrical top and vertical jewelled bands. Beside him two figures of diminishing size with hands joined, collars, bracelets and an uttarīya, one of whom wears a crested turban, the other a double-looped chignon, balance the pair opposite. Above them, variously disposed, three half-length figures in uttarīya and the usual ornaments, two with a crested turban and one with wavy hair, balance the three opposite; two are about to throw large handfuls of flowers while one joins his hands.

After the Buddha had taught his mother and the gods in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, he returned to Jambudvīpa, surrounded by gods, at Sāṃkāśya and there was a magnificent display of men, gods and of a cakravartin magically created by (the nun) Utpalavarṇā. The tradition that he came down on a central ladder flanked by Indra and Brahmā, each on his own ladder, and accompanied by deities, is, with variations, found in Pāli and sources of northern origin. Usually in the texts Brahmā's ladder is of silver and Indra's of jewels and they are on the right and left respectively; the monuments seem to agree that these positions are with reference to the Buddha. At their foot the Buddha was greeted, in the Pāli tradition, by Śāriputra and Utpalavarṇā.

His torso is muscular, his arms and legs very slender and his short lower garment is densely pleated and hangs with a thick excess of cloth between the legs. The Buddha's over-robe, covering both shoulders, apparently conceals his hands; he stands, head lowered, right hand raised to touch that of the striding male figure who, as he advances, holds up a flower or flowers; he is seen from the back and the head, hair clearly short, looks upwards and sideways over the left shoulder. He wears a uttarīya and paridhāna. A young woman, wearing ornaments, stands turned towards him, her right wrist perhaps held by the male figure, while her left hand brings its index finger to her mouth. She wears a garment passing over her left shoulder, a paridhāna round it and a scarf draped round the elbows as it falls from the headdress, which seems to consist of a wreath with a flower to the front and a coil and loop of hair above it. Beside her, almost full-length save for the legs, is a spectator or deity with long hair in a chignon and an uttarīya worn wrapped round the right arm.
In the incomplete scene a male figure kneels, one knee only on the ground which the head, showing a chignon, almost touches, back curved and wearing only a paridhāna, in front of a woman who appears to emerge from a doorway oblique to the scene, hands joined, dressed like the woman in the right-hand scene except for the single wreath of her headdress. A third figure, wearing an uttarīya and a turban with a crest on its side, turns beside the door towards the tall Buddha who appears almost compressed between the upper and lower frames, his head inclined and his damaged right hand held across the body while his left hangs free of the garment. Above the doorway is an ornamental cornice of lotus petals pointing upwards, but the architraves are too worn to show clearly whether they have ornament.
The framed columns have the usual base and a Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts.

The eyes of the figures are shown as rounded and protruding, except for those of the Buddha which are thin narrow slits between lids. Noteworthy are the naturalistic treatment of Vajrapāṇi's torso and the bold use of the partial back view in the right-hand scene.
It is tempting to see here perhaps a rare Dīpaṃkara sequence in two successive and separate frames as against the preponderance of representations using continuous narration. The transactions with the Buddha and the young woman are, however, obscure, and the young male appears to lack a chignon in the first scene and might be thought, if he were Megha, to have loosened his hair in the second where it still seems short.

Lying on his side, head turned to his right and feet away from each other, the Buddha holds his right hand, apparently emerging from the high neckline, as if in abhaya below his head and against the bordered halo. His left hand is covered by the robe, which continues in pleats below it. The hair is wavy into the uṣṇīṣa, the long oval face has partly open, expressionless eyes. The pillow under and behind the halo has bobbles at the corners, the top of the bed is covered in a textile which hangs between the turned legs with, in the middle, an ornamental scroll down to the footstool. Beside the bed sits a small meditating monk, frontal and in low relief, his robe lying spread in a straight edge below the damaged hands.
At the head of the bed a youthful Vajrapāṇi, his uttarīya plunging below his loincloth, raises his right arm, while his left holds a vajra vertically at shoulder level. Behind the bed stand four figures, each with a crested turban, collar, bracelet, earrings and, save one, an uttarīya; two appear in conversation, one of these raising his hand with the index and middle fingers pointing upwards together and the thumb perhaps extended, while another, also with a long necklace, raises both arms. At the foot of the bed a naked tonsured figure holds a flower in one hand, but the other hand, across the abdomen, seems unfinished; he talks with a monk in three garments, whose right hand with raised index and middle fingers joined makes almost the same gesture as above.

The features are sharply, if clumsily, carved, the faces sometimes heavy, the noses prominent and broad and the mouths set back between jowls.
The Indian texts agree substantially over the Buddha's last days. He became seriously ill near Vaiśālī but was able to reach the Malla country, near Kuśinagara, where Cunda, the smith, prepared him the mysterious sūkaramaddava which again made him ill. Proceeding to Kuśinagara, he lay down on his right side between two sāla trees, his head to the north, and the trees flowered unseasonably. Ānanda attended, grieving, gods assembled and the Mallas of Kuśinagara were summoned, coming in great numbers. The ascetic Subhadra was the Buddha's last convert. When the Buddha was dead, Brahmā, Indra and the monk Anuruddha (Aniruddha) recited verses, monks grieved and the Mallas came to honour his body. They could not lift it for the cremation until Anuruddha had indicated the gods' wishes and it would not burn until Mahākāśyapa, informed on the road by an ājīwika, had arrived with his followers and it then caught fire spontaneously. The Mallas took possession of the remains and would yield none to claimants among the neighbouring tribes who prepared to fight, until a brāhmaṇa had effected a peaceable division; then each erected a stupa in his own territory to enshrine a share.
In representations of the Great Decease the usually haloed Buddha lies invariably on his right side, his covered left hand down his side, the right palm outwards beside the head; a leg can be flexed and the drapery may hang as on a standing figure. The bed, with turned or carved legs, may have a mattress and pillow and a textile, sometimes decorated, hanging between the legs; a small stool also occurs. At each side one of the traditional pair of sāla is represented by a tree, commonly with evenly paired leaves on the branches, and there may be more. Attendants may include Brahmā and Indra, usually Vajrapāṇi, figures indistinguishably gods or Mallas unless, as in Calcutta 5147, they are half-length and flying figures and throwing flowers, and monks identified as Ananda, Anuruddha and Mahākāśyapa. Vajrapāṇi stands at the head of the bed as here and in the following piece, or behind it, or lies beside it, raising one arm in a gesture of grief or holding it across the top of his head. Usually at the foot of the bed is a figure with a wrapped head and a triple staff (tridaṇḍa) or a monk with or without monastic staff, the monk sometimes touching the Buddha's feet or in conversation with a naked and tonsured figure, while the figure with the triple staff, the tridaṇḍin, may be talking with a monk behind or beside the couch. To explain this confusing alternation it has been proposed that the monk behind or beside the couch may be informing the tridaṇḍin of the momentous event or he may, by a use of continuous narration, be Mahākāśyapa, who arrived seven days after the death, learning of it on the road from an ājīvika, the naked and tonsured figure, or, in a sculptural tradition found on Gandhāra reliefs, from another kind of heretical personage instead, the tridaṇḍin. Sometimes a standing monk helps up another; they are identified as Anuruddha and Ānanda. Another figure, variously seated, facing, with back to the viewer or in three-quarter view, and sometimes tonsured, as here, and sometimes with his head covered is identified as Subhadra, the last convert. When this figure has beside him a tripod of three sticks tied to each other to support a suspended bag, explained as a water bag, the reference must be to Subhadra's previous character as a parivrājaka ascetic.",Srinivasan 1997 / Gandharan Textiles: a Local Craft with a Western Connection; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/dc51a/s3),"Exhibited:

On the left an oblique doorway with sloping jambs contains a young woman looking up and holding a pot under one arm; the other, with flowers, is raised. She wears a wreath headdress with a projecting loop of hair and a flower, earrings, a collar, bracelets and anklets, a thin sleeved blouse shown by small folds at the shoulders, a garment over the left shoulder and a scarf looping into the girdle of her paridhāna. Above the door is a draped balcony with two women similarly dressed, one with arm raised to throw flowers onto the scene below. Beyond the doorway a large figure of the brāhmaṇa student Megha, in a similar posture to the young woman's, holds a small water pot and raises his right arm to throw flowers towards the Buddha Dīpaṃkara; he wears a girt animal-skin lower garment, an uttarīya over the left shoulder, the brāhmaṇa's sacrificial thread and long hair under a horizontal length of hair looped at one end. The bare torso shows rounded breasts and abdomen, the left knee is flexed and the head is oval with open eyes between the lids. Below, the same figure is shown prostrate, the back, with its flattened planes, arched above the ground, one arm and leg carried onto the lower frame and the hair clearly being spread onto the ground with Megha's left hand; his left arm continues the angular outline of the back. Above and beside the balcony is a radiate aureole showing Megha in low relief, kneeling, his right knee on the ground, hands joined, his hair now fastened into a chignon.
In front of Megha is the damaged Buddha Dīpaṃkara shown as larger than all the other figures, wearing the usual monastic garments with neckline in relief. He raises his large right hand with long fingers in abhaya, his body a gentle curve. Behind him are the half-length figure of a monk observing and an armed figure standing in almost three-quarter view, lower legs crossed, back turned to the viewer. His long hair is secured by a fillet and his curving moustache on the upturned face conveys, with his rounded staring eyes, a fierce expression. He holds his long sword by its pommel, the scabbard is suspended through the bridge at its middle from his right shoulder by a baldrick which continues round the front of the body; a short lower garment is secured by a girdle. The doorway has a sawtooth enrichment on the inner jambs, a cavetto cornice with vertically grooved lotus-petal ornament and a beam protruding at the left.
The frame consists of a sawtooth cornice and at one side a pilaster with a Corinthian capital in two distinct parts, the upper, with central leaf and corners, rather high under an upper capital of two tiers with sawtooth enrichment; on the shaft a garland with narrow ends hangs without visible attachment and under the usual base mouldings seems to be a second plinth. The plain framing fillet at the bottom is grooved as if in continuation of Megha's hair, but see also under the pilaster.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Height: 42.20 centimetres with dowl ; Height: 40.30 centimetres without dowl ; Width: 47.90 centimetres; Depth: 9.50 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
In the frame of the extended story in the Mahāvastu of Dīpaṃkara, Buddha Śākyamuni's predecessor, many details parallel the legend of Śākyamuni, but the king is Arcimat and the city Dīpavatī; the Bodhisattva whose Buddhahood as Śākyamuni Dīpaṃkara predicts is Megha. Megha saw Dīpavatī in festive array and learnt from a brāhmaṇa girl, Prakṛti, that Dīpaṃkara was awaited. From her he obtained, also to honour Dīpaṃkara, five of the flowers she was carrying in a pitcher in return for marriage in future births, a condition without effect on the Bodhisattva vow he made on seeing Dīpaṃkara arriving in procession; both Megha and Prakṛti threw their flowers which remained suspended all around Dīpaṃkara's head, stalks turned inwards, Megha spread his robe on the ground, threw himself at Dīpaṃkara's feet and wiped their soles with his hair as he made his vow. As Dīpaṃkara predicted its fulfilment, Megha rose to the height of a palm tree, threw his cloak over one shoulder and joined his hands in homage. In the Pāli tradition the Bodhisattva, Sumedha of Amaravatī, joined in preparing the road for Dīpaṃkara's visit to the town of Ramma(ka) or Rammavatī and, on seeing Dīpaṃkara, spread his mantle and hair, lay down in the mire like a bridge of planks and resolved to become a Buddha rather than reach only Nirvāṇa. Dīpaṃkara foretold that he should be Śākyamuni and offered him eight handfuls of flowers. The summary account in the Dhammapada Commentary to vv. 11-12 omits any Bodhisattva vow and instead makes the act one of especial courtesy (translated Burlingame, 1921: I, 193-4).
With no sure exceptions [Peshawar 1847 (Ingholt, 1957: fig. 188) may seem to be an exception], representations of this theme use continuous narration and Megha can appear up to four times when he obtains flowers from the girl, throws them, lies prostrate and levitates. His commonest appearances are throwing flowers and lying prostrate, while the transaction with the girl is often implied by her presence as onlooker, usually on the left of the panel and often framed in a doorway; Megha also usually faces Dīpaṃkara from the same direction, and when levitating he may kneel, sometimes in a halo, as in this panel, or is apparently upright, but examples of an almost horizontal flying figure seem confined to Japanese collections. In some instances Megha's hair is clearly spread below Dīpaṃkara's feet, but Foucher distinguishes Dīpaṃkara's treading on it, as in the Divyāvadāna, and Megha's wiping Dīpaṃkara's feet as in the Mahāvastu, which is shown by Megha's hand on Dīpaṃkara's ankle. Dīpaṃkara is accompanied by one or more of his monks (both Mahāvastu 1.231 and Divyāvadāna (c.250) refer to large numbers), but Vajrapāṇi is not invariable.
Megha is the name used for the brāhmaṇa student in the Mahāvastu account; in the Divyāvadāna he is Sumati and in the Pāli account Sumedha. In the completely different frame-story of the Divyāvadāna (Dharmarucyavadāna) c.246-53 the king is Dīpa, the city Dīpavatī and the future Bodhisattva is Sumati. All flowers at Dīpavatī had been requisitioned by Dīpa to honour Dīpaṃkara, but the lotuses in a young woman's pitcher rose up through Sumati's merits and she gave him five, keeping two, in return for the promise of marriage in all future births. When thrown, their flowers formed circular canopies that moved or stood with Dīpaṃkara, and in a muddy place Sumati asked Dīpaṃkara to stand on his ascetic's hair (jaṭā) in token of Sumati's future Buddhahood; when Dīpaṃkara did so and affirmed it, Sumati rose the height of seven fan-palm trees.

This relief was once part of a larger panel which, in all probability, featured a Buddha figure at the centre and the Bodhisattva Padmapāṇi on the opposite side. The Buddha flanked by two Bodhisattvas was a common arrangement in Buddhist sculpture from early in its history. The representation of Vajrapāṇi shows that his iconography, at least in ancient Gandhāra, was in part derived from Hercules (see 1776.1108.2) who often wears a lion-skin in the same manner, recalling the hero's defeat of the Nemean Lion. Hercules was widely venerated as a hero and saviour in western Asia during the early centuries of the present era. As a great champion, who nevertheless understood the human condition, Hercules was easily assimilated into Mahāyāna Buddhism.
This relief, aside from its interest as a document of religious development, illustrates a well-known phenomenon in the history of art, namely, that images change in meaning before they change in appearance.; Zwalf 1996:
The manner of wearing the lion's skin is common in the iconography of Heracles (see Lexicon, 1981-8: iv, 7281F., 79iff.) and it derives from his slaying of the Nemean lion; the same style was adopted by or for rulers claiming descent from Heracles, among whom was Alexander the Great.

The Bodhisattva's damaged forearms originally met in dhyāna; he is naked to the waist where a twisted roll of textile forms a girdle; the upper garment is distinguishable only as a narrow strip wound above each elbow and falling to the side. Below the waist he is covered with very summary indications of a garment, but the soles seem bare. His head, unevenly sliced at right angles to the slab, is bearded on one side along the jaw to the chin and still has one deep-set eye, a prominent cheek-bone and horizontal mouth below a moustache. The hair is drawn back from a sharp hairline into the uṣṇīṣa. The very large halo, but for an inner groove defining a border, is plain. The flat-shouldered torso is ribbed, the top of the rib cage plunging in a deep 'V' below the protruding vertebrae. Nippled breasts project slightly and the waist is indrawn at the navel. The posture is dramatically straight and still, the arms bony. The face of the grass-covered rectangular seat has triangular panels each containing a large, roughly triangular indentation.

In higher relief beside him is a full-faced woman wearing a long tunic falling about her feet and a long overgarment draped over her left shoulder, her sleeves of thick material, her joined hands containing perhaps a floral offering or garland. She wears hoop earrings, a collar and hair coiled at the back of the head and resembling a wreath. Opposite, a standing male figure, corresponding to Vajrapāṇi but turning sideways, wears Indra's headdress with a moulded cylindrical top, earrings, collar and uttarīya; he holds flowers in both hands. Beside him a male figure wearing a sleeved tunic and an uttarīya, earrings and collar, joins his hands with an offering also.
Below are a plain framing fillet and an uneven groove suggesting a plinth at the base of the seat.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Jamalgarhi,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 6.80 centimetres; Height: 18.30 inches; Width: 19.80 centimetres,,"Descriptions of the Bodhisattva's fruitless search for enlightenment by traditional austerities, which reduced him to extreme emaciation, are described in some detail in the texts naming the forms of practice which induced it and it has recently been argued that the yogic concepts of the cakras, and the brahmarandhra in particular, may explain the concentration, in apparently significant numbers, of holes in the uṣṇīṣa of the fasting Bodhisattva in Gandhara. During these practices gods reported his imminent death to the Bodhisattva's mother in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, but when she came she was consoled that he would attain nirvāṇa; she left him to continue his practices but his father sent daily messengers to learn of his son's condition and the gods watched day and night and worshipped him. Now the Bodhisattva decided that asceticism did not lead to salvation and resolved to take food again. The gods offered to feed him through the pores of his hair but he refused and preferred either to prepare his own food, supplemented with milk-rice from Sujātā, a village headman's daughter, or to take it from her entirely. The Pāli tradition is, in canonical accounts, substantially similar as to the ascetic practices, but the story of Sujātā and her food offering to the Bodhisattva as he sat under a 'nyagrodha' is in the commentatorial literature and refers to the eve of the Enlightenment when the Bodhisattva had already begged food, broken his fast and resumed his former appearance.
Apparently evolved in and at first confined to Gandhāra, figures of the fasting Bodhisattva, whether large, as at Lahore and Peshawar, or that from Shotorak and smaller pieces, may have been meditational images besides serving narrative purposes, perhaps with separate flanking figures. Relief panels with flanking figures are not especially numerous and also differ among themselves too much to provide dependable explanations for this piece. Examples with female assistants are inconclusive and male assistants range from donors to deities.
For quite exceptional sequences of very unusual aspect see Berlin MIK 1 79,14 where, from right to left, the emaciated Bodhisattva is flanked by Brahmā and Indra and crosses the Nairañjanā and, quite restored, receives bowls from flanking females; and a strip, in a private Japanese collection, where the skeletal Bodhisattva is flanked by tormenting village children, then by women offering a bowl and water pot respectively and, finally, in his normal appearance, receives a bundle of grass.
While it seems certain that the Bodhisattva is here attended by Vajrapāṇi and Indra, the flanking and formally paired male and female worshippers seem like donors and may be intentionally ambiguous. Foucher prefers to see in the outer male worshipper Brahmā with a collar (see BM 1917.0501.1) beside Indra, while the corresponding female, if not Māyā come from the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, then Sujātā offering food.
For a Western affinity for the fasting Bodhisattva seen by Rowland in the brutal realism of the Hellenistic art of Alexandria, compare Lamb, 1929: pl. LXXVIIa.; Zwalf 1985
Disappointed by spiritual masters, the Bodhisattva took to severe fasting and was even reported dead. When fasts failed to reveal the truth, he turned to the middle way between worldliness and mortification, one definition of the Buddhist path to salvation. He accepted a rice-brew from a village headman's daughter, who had come to offer it to a nature spirit in thanksgiving for the birth of a son. She stands beside the emaciated Bodhisattva with his frequent companions, the gods Indra and Brahmā, and his protector Vajrapāṇi.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The garland running around the stupa may be seen as an offering with fertility imagery where the amorino is appropriately a yakṣa. The earlier garlanding of domes is illustrated at Bharhut and Sanci, where, as perhaps at Chatpat and Taxila, it was supported by pegs (compare BM 1892.1103.78, BM 1959.0717.1, BM 1949.0718.48 and BM 1904.1217.32).
The stone garland frieze, frequent on single narrow panels, both flat and curved, is not often found on the same slab as other horizontal registers. It occurs under a false gable arch, on stupa domes, on solid drums, on a fragment showing a double-domed roof, on a rectangular stupa platform, as an integral register below a preaching Buddha panel and below a row of Buddhas. The motif is found on stair-risers (BM 1880.883 and BM 1880.59) and on a panel reused beside the porch of a shrine at Butkara III.
The classical affinities of the continuous garland are referred generally to the eastern Mediterranean and a 2nd-century introduction. Combaz, with comparisons, proposes the garland frieze in Gandhāra as a classicising expression of a vegetal motif already present in the Indian tradition. The diffusion of the garland from Gandhāra may be seen at Kuṣāṇa Mathurā and, in the fifth century, in Kashmir.
For reliefs showing garlands on stupa domes, without amorini and perhaps to be thought of as hanging from pegs like BM 1892.1103.78, BM 1959.0717.1 and BM 1949.0718.48; see also BM 1902.1002.29 (with open flowers in the dips as at Butkara I).

If the presence of Brahmā, notwithstanding the rare collar, is admitted together with that of Indra, this scene may illustrate the Instigation (saṃcodana) in which these and other gods urge the Bodhisattva to renounce the world (see also BM 1890.1116.1). Commenting on the rather loose iconography for this subject, Foucher, 1905-51: 11, 222, refers to instances showing a turbaned and meditating figure under branches which he explains as contamination from outdoor scenes. If instead this scene illustrates the Bodhisattva Śvetaketu in the Tuṣita heaven considering his last birth as Siddhārtha, it has some agreements with the well-known relief from Sikri ascribed to this theme, and there is literary support for the presence of Brahmā and Indra. Lobo, proposing another iconograhy for the Tuṣita scenes, has identified the Sikri panel as showing the Bodhisatva's meditations before the earthly Instigation, and in another, where a turbaned Bodhisattva in dhyāna is shown as here together with Brahmā and Indra, she believes the meditations are combined with the Instigation itself.
For the Instigation the texts relate how, either before or after his revulsion among the women, Indra, Brahmā and other gods urge the Bodhisattva to leave the palace and promise him an unhindered departure and Enlightenment.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, chipped.

(Object),,,"Stupa drum panel showing two scenes, one of the Dīpaṃkara jātaka in two incidents, beneath two horizontal registers. From right to left, in the first scene, the haloed and damaged Dīpaṃkara is in abhaya and three-quarter view. The standing Megha raises his damaged right hand holding flowers, his left holds a broken water pot at his waist; he wears an ascetic's tunic with bared right shoulder and his hair is gathered into a chignon. Megha reappears below in a curved posture on hands and knees, hair perhaps extending below Dlpamkara's feet. An oblique doorway behind, with moulded sloping jambs, a rectangular threshold and an indistinct lintel, frame Prakṛti who holds a pot at her waist. Behind Dīpaṃkara a burly Vajrapāṇi with tightly curled hair holds his vajra along the line of his narrow plunging uttarīya, which just reveals the genitals. Behind him are two monks in rhythmically curved stance, their right arms in the robe across the chest and the left hanging down with a curved gathering of drapery to the bottom of the garment.
In the next scene, in the centre, a turbaned and haloed figure with uttarīya and paridhāna, and showing a muscular chest and arm, stands with one arm down, the other on the hip, wearing the usual ornaments. Beside him his queen is seated on a long draped seat, her raised right hand holding a lotus; she wears a wreath headdress with protruding loop of hair and ornaments. The kneeling figure on each side appears to be female, with anklets and girdles, and hands joined. Behind and beside each suppliant a pair of similar standing females join hands and hold flowers. All the female figures on this panel appear to wear a tunic with a paridhāna round it; features, where they survive, are sharp with rounded eyes.
Flanking the scenes are framed columns with faceted (incomplete) tapering shafts under Corinthian capitals and with tori at the bases recalling pots. Above are an ovolo with pointed leaf enrichment under a fillet and a chequerboard register of alternating blocks and recesses. At the top a register of arches on very summary Corinthian capitals of tapering pilasters, perhaps representing horizontal ""S"" brackets, contains a series of cult objects, some on rectangular draped bases. From right to left these are: a damaged disc; the Bodhisattva's crested turban; another disc (perhaps the sun disc or halo); an ascetic's hut or a small vihdra with domed roof; the Buddha's begging bowl; another turban; a draped urn; the vajra; another bowl; and a draped urn as more commonly known from the sequence of the Buddha's obsequies.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Takht-i-Bahi,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 6.20 centimetres; Height: 22 centimetres; Width: 53.40 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:

(Object),,,"Panel showing the Bodhisattva as King Śibi ransoming a pigeon with his own flesh. From right to left a youthful haloed deity with moustache and a chignon bound at the base stands almost in profile with his right hand raised, palm outward. He wears a paridhāna and uttarīya, a collar with small pendants and double bracelets, that on his left wrist beaded and with discs. Beside him Indra, slightly turned towards the king, raises his right hand at right angles to himself, the thumb across the palm, a flat vajra in the left hand and wearing paridhāna and uttarīya in the narrow mode. He is crowned with his cylindrical cap, its side cross-hatched and with mouldings above, which rests on a wreath or a rounded ornamental brim, and wears one wide flat bracelet and another like that of the deity beside him, a collar and a necklace. Between him and the group around Śibi an almost frontal figure, turned slightly towards the king and with a small double-looped chignon on a bowl crop hairstyle, earrings, moustache, paridhāna and uttarīya, holds a weighing device of steelyard type consisting of a suspended bar also supported by a damaged hand. At one end what must be the king's flesh is heaped in a suspended bag, its weight measured along the other, longer side of the bar. Above is a damaged projection discussed below.
At the left the drooping king is seated on a throne, supporting himself over one side at the right armpit while with his other arm he clasps the woman in front of him, his hand on her back. The footstool, adorned with three open flowers, emphasises a large foot and the bared leg, thrust forward, from which a kneeling figure with moustache, paridhāna, uttarīya and earrings, cuts with a knife. The king has a moustache, wears a crested turban, a collar with large circular pendants and a necklace, armlets, bracelets, earrings, paridhāna and uttarīya. The woman in front of him, with wreath headdress and necklace, long-sleeved garment, a scarf or long garment draped over her left shoulder and braid on the back, leans forward, stretching out her left hand to the king's side. Above the king is a parasol decorated with a trellised motif; the throne, with back and sides, has a textile draped over the side beneath the king's arm, a floral panel and an elaborate turned leg beside which stands the pigeon.
On all the figures drapery folds are shown by dense grooves and ridges, heads are well shaped, round to oval and the features clear-cut with open eyes and distinct upper lids. The torsos are generally smooth with gentle modelling, nipples and gashed navels on the males. The heavy lids give a certain uniformity of appearance and this suggests a sad and solemn participation of all the protagonists. The king's forehead is puckered in pain and the angle of his head, like that of the other actors, and the forward posture of the woman, whose supporting arm is undercut, emphasise the pathos of the event. The composition balances the group of tall deities observing, Indra now in his true form at the climax of the sacrifice, the central figure of the weigher in a gentle compassionate dehanchement, holding the suspended flesh in emphatic relief, and the heads of the king, the woman and the wiclder of the knife aligned in a triangular scheme.
The broken projection above the figure with the steelyard must be the hawk or falcon; we appear to have continuous narration, with Indra and his earlier form as bird and correspondingly the youthful figure on the right may be the divine Viśvakarmā along with his form as the pigeon.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 5.50 centimetres; Height: 23.30 centimetres; Width: 32.40 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The theme, to be distinguished from Śibi's gift of his eyes (also commemorated on one of the 'four great stupas'), occurs, with variants, in different texts and tells how Indra tested the resolve of the Bodhisattva in his birth as King Śibi. Śibi, who had vowed to protect all creatures, ransomed a pigeon pursued by Indra disguised as a falcon, eagle, or sparrow-hawk, while the pigeon was really the god Viśvakarmā acting at Indra's behest. Śibi offered in his own flesh the equivalent of the pigeon's weight; parts of his body were successively cut off and heaped into a scale, but the pigeon proved still too heavy until the king, with what was left of himself, got into it. In this extremity he reaffirmed his joy at fulfilling the Bodhisattva vow and prayed, in token of his sincerity, to become whole again; and this then came about. The two gods resumed their own forms.
The execution recalls the so-called Buner group; the drapery the 'drawing' manner of Butkara I; Viśvakarmā/Brahmā's necklace that of a spectator on Peshawar 2071 (Ingholt, 1957: fig. 16); and compare Fabregues.

As with sandalwood objects, few brittle earthenware shrines of the Tang and pre-Tang period survive. It is therefore notable that several are taken either from the same or similar moulds. These depict the Buddha seated below the double trees associated with his death. In China the ‘Mahāpari-nirvāṇasūtra’ was regarded by Zhiyi (AD 531-97), founder of the Tiantai sect, as belonging to the last, supreme stage of the Buddha's teaching, and as Tiantai gained in popularity during the 6th century so did scenes and motifs related to the ‘sūtra’. In this case Sakyamuni is shown meditating below the trees, not lying.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith,On display (G33/dc10a/s1),,,buddha,Representation of: Buddha (Śākyamuni/Shijiamouni/Shaka),,Associated Event: Death of Buddha,,,,,,1982,,,Asia,,"1982,0127.1",,,,,198201271

From Whitfield 1985:
This seated figure, entirely flat at the back, was made in a mould as an appliqué piece. It was one of the Buddha figures in the nimbus of a colossal standing figure of the Buddha, of which only the lower legs and drapery were still extant when Stein examined and photographed the site (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XIVb). The oval head, which has lost the facial features, echoes the treatment seen in the large head (Pl. 63). The regular drapery folds are for the most part simple incised lines, hugging the form beneath and following the general conventions of Gandharan sculpture. Due to early consolidation work, the surface of the figure has acquired a shine which differs from the matt appearance of the original red clay wash.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此佛坐像的背面完全是平的，是用模子製作的化佛。化佛是安裝在巨大佛立像的頭光上的，當斯坦因考查此遺迹進行拍照時，那巨像的腳尖和衣紋還殘留著（參照《古代和田》圖版XIV.b）。頭部爲橢圓形，面部已經破損，其色彩大概與圖63的佛頭相同。另外，衣紋線基本是用簡單而有規則的刻線表現，衣服下的線條很有肉感，大概融合了犍陀羅雕刻的流派。由於早期的固化作用，像的表面出現一層光澤，這與紅粘土製品表面沒有光澤是不同的。","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts",Not on display,,,buddha; 佛 (Chinese),Representation of: Buddha;  Representation of: 佛陀,,,,,,,,1907,"The 1907-11-11 group refers to objects from Stein's First Central Asian  Expedition, 1900-01.

From Whitfield 1985:
Miniature plaques such as these were produced in quantity by the use of moulds, and applied to form parts of the nimbus decoration of larger statues. In the case of many of the Rawak figures, this decoration was quite elaborate (see Gropp, 1974, Fig. 110, p. 233), and they appear around the edges of the aureoles of standing figures as well as in the nimbus (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XVIIIc). As Stein himself wrote:
Special artistic interest attaches to the remains of the elaborate aureoles which ... encircled these statues. They varied but little in details. Every-where there was a border formed by a cloud-scroll, and within it a broad band showing small plaques of seated Buddhas or Bodhisattvas inserted between wreaths of a very graceful bead-ornament. The latter were gathered at intervals into bunches surmounted y a fleur-de-lis. A second band of small seated Buddhas seems to have filled the space left between the highly ornamental border and the edges of the drapery. (Ibid., Vol. I, p.499)
The plaque from Dandan-oilik, probably somewhat later than that from Rawak, had a similar purpose: it bears traces of pigment as follows: “hair black, robe brown, seat pink, inner part of vesica pink, outer ray emerald green. The whole appears to have been on background of indigo” (ibid., Vol. I, p.289).; Chinese

Amongst the most remarkable of all services made during this period is the well-known pearlware 'Water Lily' service ordered in 1807 and delivered in 1808 to Dr Robert Darwin, son of Dr Erasmus Darwin and father of the evolutionist Charles Darwin. This plate is from the service and was given to A. W. Franks by Dr Joseph Hooker (1817-1911), Director of Kew Gardens between 1865 and 1885 and friend of Charles Darwin. The 'Water Lily' pattern almost certainly represents the earliest use of brown underglaze printing in Staffordshire that can be accurately dated. The decision to introduce the manufacture of underglaze printed ware at Etruria (overglaze printing having been used since the 1770s) was taken on 31 March 1805. The 'Water Lily' pattern was the first to be used at Etruria that reproduced identifiable botanical prints. The engravings of the water lilies, all members of the 'Nymphaeaceae' family, indigenous to watery places, have been identified as: 'nymphaea stellata', or starry water lily, on the left; 'nymphaea lotus', or Lotus of Egypt, on the right; and 'nelumbium speciosum', or sacred Lotus of Buddha, the fully opened flower in the centre, with large, veined indented leaves. The lilies were all copied either from the 'Botanist's Repository' or from the 'Botanical Magazine', periodicals published, between October 1803 and February 1806.

The great Buddhist stūpa at Amarāvatī was one of the most important centres of Buddhism in southern India from the early centuries of the present era until its complete abandonment some time after the fourteenth century. This pre-eminence was initially based on the economic power of the Sātavāhana kings who are closely associated with the city of Dharaṇīkoṭa, close to the stūpa. During the Sātavāhana period, the city no doubt provided a ready source of patronage, a situation only changed by the rise of the Ikṣvāku dynasty based at Nāgārjunakoṇḍa further up the river Krishna.
In the manner of early Buddhist stūpa, the whole structure was surrounded by a railing fence of which the present example is a part. The railing, vedikā, was made up of upright elements (such as this) and cross-bars which connected these standing, horizontal parts. The outer faces of the uprights were decorated with lotus blossoms and small figural scenes -including those showing gaṇas playing music and dancing. The inner face, as seen here, was the face which would have been seen by devotees performing pradakṣiṇā; this was conceived rather differently. Here scenes from the life of the Buddha and from the jātakas were shown, as moral precepts to be 'read' by those who processed around the stūpa.
Of great interest in the roundel is the symbolic indication of the presence of the holy child, by footprints on the cloth held by the old man in the centre of the roundel. There is no bodily image shown. This relief belongs to that earlier period at Amaravati when the bodily form is still only shown symbolically; during the next century this was to change with profound consequences not only in the Indian subcontinent, but throughout Southeast Asia and the Far East.","Tripe 1859 / Photographs of the Elliot Marbles and other subjects in the Central Museum, Madras; Fergusson 1873 / Tree and Serpent Worship; Barrett 1954 / Sculptures from Amaravati in the British Museum; Morley 1985 / Indian Sculpture; Knox 1992 / Amaravati: Buddhist sculpture from the Great Stupa; Blurton 1997 / The Enduring Image: Treasures from the British Museum",Not on display,"Exhibited:

The coins are identifiable from Masson's description of 'Indo-Scythic' coins and account of the finds in Wilson 1841, p.118 as Kushan coins of Wima Kadphises, Kanishka I and Huvishka, i.e. a similar combination of the same types as the 21 coins from Chahar Bagh Stupa 4 (see CM 1979,0215.21-41). 
The reliquary and associated finds were excavated in 1836 (MSS Eur. E161/VII, f.27).They were dispatched from Kabul by Masson in October 1836, but only reached London in March 1839, too late for more than a brief note in Wilson 1841.","Masson MSS Eur.

C. Fabrègues: The motif of the column surmounted by a lion recalls the pillars bearing the edicts of the Mauryan king Ashoka (c. 269–232 BC) which were erected all over India at sites such as Lauriya-Nandangarh (Thapar 1997, pp.5-6). Pillars similarly mounted with seated lions were also erected beside stupas at Buddhist sites such as Saidu Sharif I in Swat, dated 1st–5th century (Faccenna and Callieri 2003, pp.311, 314, fig.21), the lion being a symbol of the Budda, lion of the Shakya clan (Rowland 1953, pl.8). The women on the ring may be interpreted as worshipping the Buddha through circumambulation of the pillar, as is depicted on a sandstone relief from Mathura in the Lucknow Museum attributable to the 1st century AD (Lucknow State Museum, J.268: Klimburg-Salter 1995, fig.95a).

For the second part see BM 1880.38. From right to left are a damaged figure, perhaps the jeweller of the story, offering food to a monk holding a staff, and the jeweller again, in chignon and uttarīya, working on a table, below which is the very damaged outline of a large bird. At the doorway of the jeweller's interior the same monk emerges with a staff and bowl. Beyond a tree the jeweller, in chignon, earrings, uttarīya and paridhāna, watches the arrest of the monk by a person in a girt knee-length tunic, trousers and shod feet who stands with his left hand on his hip and his right hand holding perhaps a staff of office (daṇḍa) at shoulder level.
In the next scene the officer of justice (or the jeweller's servant) appears to seize the monk's staff and immediately afterwards he and another in nomad dress assault him: the monk is apparently stripped to his lower garment, one man pinions him by both hands from behind, pushing with a raised knee as he is pulled with a cangue, lasso or halter round his neck by the other who lifts a staff or club while resting one leg on a bird which appears to peck the ground at the monk's feet. Beyond a tree are three figures: the monk, fully dressed again but without his staff and bowl, his hands covered in his robe, is flanked by figures in uttarīya and paridhāna, one joining his hands while the other may hold flowers in his right hand at shoulder level and his left hand on his hip. The monk, restored to favour and flanked by the jeweller, may be learning the true state of affairs from the worshipping Indra, come to testify to the monk's innocence.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Jamalgarhi,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 4.80 centimetres as visible ; Height: 17.50 centimetres; Width: 104.20 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The damaged horizontal framing elements are those of BM 1880.54. Foucher, 1917a: 271-81, quotes two Chinese texts ['Aśvaghoṣa Sūtrālaṃkāra' (French translation in Huber, 1908: 321-30) and 'Jing lu yi xiang' (Nanjio 1329 = Taisho IV.203), translated in Chavannes, 1910-34: III, 210-11 (no. 440)] which tell how a bird (a parrot in the 'Jing lu yi xiang' and a goose in 'Aśvaghoṣa')  swallowed a valuable pearl while a monk on his begging round was in a jeweller's shop and its owner was absent fetching him food. Rather than reveal this and cause the bird's death, the monk, while denying his own guilt, preferred to be unjustly accused and beaten by the jeweller until the blood ran. The bird attempted to drink it and was accidentally killed by the blows. The monk then became free to speak, the bird was cut open and the pearl found inside it. In pointing out that this relief is exceptional in representing a theme not connected with the Buddha, Foucher wonders whether, in the version known to the Gandhāra sculptor, the monk might have been one of his particular companions and only very hesitantly connects it with Lahore 119, a fragment showing a monk tied to a post or pillory. Foucher, 1917a: 274, also identifies the first figure as thejeweller by his Roman type of steelyard, but it is not distinguishable in the now damaged feature which even in the early photograph was very abraded and seems only the outstretched hand(s) of the person offering. The activity at the table in Foucher's view is thejeweller's search for the gem swallowed by the bird. Foucher, ibid.: 273, actually believes that the bird is drinking the monk's blood. The supposed Indra lacks headdress, bracelets and necklace. Consequently, Foucher admits that this interpretation is weak.

From Whitfield 1985:
Each side of this plaque carries a figure of the Buddha in an identical standing position, the right hand in abhaya-mudra, conferring absence of fear. On the side seen here, he is clad in a red robe, within an oval vesica which has lost all pigment. The details of the face are outlined in red on a white ground, while the folds of the robe are in ink. On the other side (Fig. 95). The Buddha is unclad save for a loin cloth; the hands are in the same mudra. Much of the white pigment has been lost, but a few details such as the vajra on the forearm and the double rings on the upper legs show that this is Vairocana, the Buddha in his cosmic aspect, with various forms (in which he may exist) depicted on, meaning within, his body.
Eiichi Matsumoto, in a series of articles in 1936 (Kokka, nos. 548, 549, 551), was the first to point out the importance of Khotan as a centre of the Avatamsaka Sutra and in its eastward propagation from the fifth century or even earlier until the close of the eighth century. Between A.D. 418 and 421 the first Chinese translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra was made by Buddhabhadra from a Sanskrit version of the sutra obtained from Khotan. More recently, the problems of the iconography of Khotanese Buddhism have been explored by Joanna Williams (1973, pp. 117-24), who was able to find still more examples of the Cosmic Vairocana among the extant remnants of the art of Khotan. Those shown in this volume include a fragment of a wall painting from Khadalik (Pl. 53-4) and a plaque from Farhad-beg-yailaki (Pl. 72), as well as the present example. Still other wall paintings and plaques have been published by Gerd Gropp (1974; see especially pp. 132-33).
The style revealed in these two figures shows little evidence of Chinese influence. The whole of each figure conforms closely to the shallow curves of the surrounding vesica; the legs are almost straight, the arms held close to the sides, the head a large oval with features almost geometrically disposed. In the robed figure of Pl. 71 the drapery lines still echo fairly closely the classical Gandharan arrangement, the left hand holding a loop of robe. At Dunhuang we find more movement even in the figures of the earliest caves, while the first example of the Cosmic Vairocana, from Cave 428 of the Northern Zhou (A.D. 550-57) already shows a more developed type of Vairocana, no longer naked but clad in an ample robe on which are depicted scenes of Mt.

此木板畫的兩面都繪著右手結施無畏印的佛立像。本圖所揭示的面上，佛穿赤褐色衣，有橢圓形頭光，但頭光的顔色幾乎全部殘失。佛的臉部則是在白底上施以紅色的輪廓線，衣褶則用墨綫。背面（Fig. 95）的佛是以布纏腰的裸身，手印與前相同，白色顔料大多已脫落，從前膊的金剛杵及膝蓋上方雙層的輪等特徵可看出是毘廬遮那佛，身上畫著各種形象（其中也包括佛）。
松本榮一博士于1936年發表的一系列論文（《國華》，第548、549、551號）中首次指出了于闐作爲《華嚴經》中心的重要性，以及《華嚴經》的東漸是從5世紀或稍早些到8世紀末。而418年至421年間佛馱跋陀羅首次進行的《華嚴經》漢譯，也是譯自從于闐獲得的梵文經典。對於和田的佛教圖像，近年Joanna Williams進行了調查（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973年，頁117-124），從大量和田繪畫中發現了許多毘廬遮那佛像。本書所舉出的毘廬遮那佛像的作品，除本圖外，還可見於喀達里克的壁畫斷片（圖53－4）以及法哈特伯克亞依拉克（末城）的木板畫（圖72），而在Gerd Gropp的著作（1974年，特別是頁132-133）中還其他壁畫和木板畫的例子。
這兩個圖像在風格上幾乎感覺不到中國影響的因素。身體恰好容在用流暢的線條繪的身光裏，兩腿筆直，兩臂緊貼在身體兩側，橢圓形的頭部幾乎是用幾何圖案處理的。圖71左手所執衣邊的衣紋處理，可看出古典的犍陀羅雕刻殘影。在敦煌，早期石窟造像就有比此有發展的造像。在北周時期（550～557年）的第428窟展示了成熟的毘盧遮那佛造像，不裸身，著衣，衣上還畫有須彌山（參照《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第1卷，圖162）。從上所述，可以考慮此木板畫最遲在6世紀就出現了。; The Department of Asia would like to thank Xanthe Carmichael for her help with updating the information on the site of Dandan-Uiliq.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
This votive plaque was found by Stein in a large cella, 5.4 m by 4.2 m, and surrounded on three sides by a circumambulatory passage 1.8 m wide, behind the square image base. Five more plaques were found along the wall. Vairocana, the supreme Buddha, is recognized by the other images appearing on his body: two seated Buddhas appear on his torso, symbols of the sun and moon on his right and left shoulders, pairs of long rectangles on each upper arm, and a bird on each forearm, besides many double circles. The long rectangles are generally taken to represent the scriptures in the form of pothi. Joanna Williams (1973) has suggested that “the significance of the books on the arms of the Cosmic Vairocana possibly lies in their identification with the Avatamsaka Sutra itself, indicating the unusual importance of the literary basis for the iconography” (p. 123; see the notes to Pl. 71).
The buildings F. Ⅱ at Farhad-beg-yailaki, of which F. Ⅱ. iii formed a part, were thought by Stein to be the living quarters of a small monastery. The coins found at the site were all wushu pieces of the Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220), with no Tang coins, and for this as well as for stylistic reasons Stein concluded that the site had been abandoned at some time between A.D. 519, when the Chinese monk Song Yun described Mocheng (identified with Charchan by Stein; see Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1255), and the end of the sixth century. This conclusion still seems to be a reasonable one: the oval shape of the head and the protruding eyes recall the three dimensional images of the Buddha from Rawak.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此木板畫是斯坦因從三面圍有1.8m寬的走廊5.4m×4.2m的大殿的方型台座背後發現的。在這裏，沿著牆壁還發現了五件木板畫。根據身上畫的各種形象，可確認本圖的像是至高無上的毘盧遮那佛，即軀幹上有兩身坐佛，兩肩上有象徵性的日月，上臂有豎的長方形，前臂上是鳥和小的同心圓。長方形一般是表示梵夾形式的佛典。Joanna Williams則認爲“毘盧遮那佛兩臂上所繪的經本，在圖像學上作爲文獻，可以認爲它就是《華嚴經》”（參照《和田佛教美術圖像》，1973年，123頁）。
斯坦因認爲，末城F. Ⅱ. iii的建築物，是這個小型寺院的生活區。此遺迹發現的貨幣都是東漢末年（25～220年）的五銖錢，沒有唐代的貨幣，從此情況及風格上的特點綜合考慮，斯坦因得出了此遺迹在中國僧人宋雲曾到過末城（斯坦因把記爲末城。參照《西域》，卷3，1255頁）的519年至6世紀末間被遺棄的結論。本圖像的橢圓形頭部和突出的眼睛等，使人想起熱瓦克佛像的立體感，斯坦因的觀點迄今爲止仍是最有說服力的。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
This plaque is almost the same size as the one bearing the story of the Silk Princess (Pl. 66), but the reverse is painted as well (though not reproduced here) with five small images of the Buddha, three of them completely effaced, the other two in purple robes, sitting within pale blue mandorlas as though in an arcade. They are similar to the rows of small Buddhas from wall painting fragments in the Khotan area.
On the front the two main figures are larger: on the left the torso of a male figure, holding a fan and looking towards an animal-headed deity, which is crowned and splendidly garbed in red and blue. The deity was identified by Stein as the Rat King: according to a legend related by Xuanzang in Da Tang xiyu ji, the king of Khotan was able to defeat an attack by the Xiongnu thanks to golden rats which gnawed the bowstrings and other gear of the latter, and which were consequently worshipped at a shrine west of Khotan. Kumagai Nobuo (1962, p. 102) notes that this plaque links folk legends with Buddhism in a special way not found among the terracottas from Khotan. Joanna Williams (1973, p. 152) considers that it is equally possible that the figure may represent a wolf head as in a votive plaque from Tarishlak (Serindia, Pl. XII) and so one of the grahas, or beings with supernatural influence over the health of children. Another votive plaque (Fig. 96), showing two women each holding a baby, must have been intended to secure protection for them, while one of the six female spirits shown in Vol. 2, Pl. 75 is a wolf-headed figure, identified in the Khotanese inscription as Mukhamanda: this deity, according to the Chinese inscription also on the painting, had to be propitiated in order to protect the child. Thus the question of identification of the middle figure must remain open. The third smaller figure has suffered some abrasion and does not help to resolve the matter.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此木板畫與《養蠶西漸傳說》的木板畫（圖66）的尺寸大致相同，但是背面也繪著五身小佛像（本書未收錄），其中三身完全消失，剩下的兩身著紫衣，坐在拱形的淡青色背光中。這些像與和田壁畫斷片中數排小千佛像相似。
正面的三像中，二身主尊的像很大。左邊的男像未完成，手持團扇，注視著頭戴寶冠、身穿赤和青衣服的獸頭像。有關此獸頭像，斯坦因根據玄奘《大唐西域記》的故事，判定爲鼠王。此故事是，大群金色的鼠咬斷匈奴的弓弦及其它的裝備，幫助于闐王擊敗匈奴人的襲擊，王在于闐的西邊爲鼠建祠堂進行祭祀。而熊谷宣夫先生（參照〈西域美術〉――《西域文化研究》第5卷，1962，102頁）認爲，此故事不見於和田出土的陶器，體現了民俗故事與佛教相結合的特殊連系。另外，Joanna Williams認爲，“此像如同Tarishlak出土的木板畫（《西域》，圖XII）可能是狼頭，或許是羯羅訶之一，或許是掌管兒童健康的神靈之一”（參照《和田佛教美術圖像》，152頁）。還有繪著兩個婦人各自抱著嬰兒的木板畫（Fig. 96），一定是在祈求兒童的安全。另外，本書第2卷圖75的六身女神像中，有一身的題記為于闐文，據Mukhamanda的解讀，就是狼頭像。而同一畫面上的漢文題記記載為保護兒童，不得不取悅該女神。因而對中間像的判斷仍是需要解決的問題。第三尊小像但由於已磨損，無助於解決問題。; The Department of Asia would like to thank Xanthe Carmichael for her help with updating the information on the site of Dandan-Uiliq.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Tucker 2003 / The Silk Road.

From Whitfield 1985:
This panel was found in the same circumstances as that in the previous plate. Although only about half as long, it is painted in a similar style on the front, and the back is painted as well (Fig. 97). This plate shows the front, with three seated figures all in the characteristic pose looking to their right. The identification of these figures has been put forward by Joanna Williams in the article already quoted in the notes to the preceding plate. She identifies the figure on the left as Indra, crowned and holding a vajra; at the other end could be Brahma, with three (out of four) heads and a third eye in each, holding a bow and arrows and a drinking bowl. The figure in the centre is suggested with less certainty by Williams as a goddess of abundance, in which case this whole group, with the Hindu gods Indra and Brahma might refer to an event such as the Buddha’s birth. The goddess holds aloft the sun and moon, as do some of the other deities in this series of votive panels from Khotan (see Pl. 70-1), and another unidentified attribute.
On the reverse (Fig. 97), two Buddhas are seated in the centre, looking towards one another, one in a red robe, the other in white, with fine drapery lines in ink. At either side sits another figure. That on the left is apparently a Bodhisattva, nude to the waist and wearing red trousers with white floral spots. The corresponding figure on the right is almost completely effaced.; Chinese

From Whitfield 1985:
This is one of the most arresting of the painted wooden plaques found by Stein at Dandan-oilik, all of which owe their fine state of preservation to the fact that they were placed above floor level. D.X at this site was a small cella with wall paintings of rows of small Buddha figures and a single stucco image, nothing of which remained, however, save the octagonal base, waisted in hourglass fashion, with a broad ledge at the bottom for offerings. The plaque was standing on end against one of the facets of the base.
The figures are depicted, as in the fragments of wall painting from Khadalik, with the main features outlined in red, and the upper eyelids and eyebrows in black. Stein recognized the subject as the legend of the introduction of sericulture to Khotan. The central figure is the Chinese princess who, according to Xuanzang (Da Tang xiyu ji, Chapter 12), warned by the envoys that there was no means of raising silkworms or mulberry leaves in Khotan, hid mulberry seeds and the eggs of the silk moth in her headdress (here indicated by the attendant on the left) and smuggled them to Khotan to raise silkworms from them, thereby circumventing the Chinese embargo on their export, which had previously frustrated the king of Khotan’s efforts to obtain the means of making silk. At the border post, the official did not dare to examine her headdress. The resulting cocoons are seen in a basket in front of the princess.
At the far right another figure stands by a loom with stretched warp, holding a beating comb in her hand, like those illustrated in Figs. 34-35. Behind her is an object that may be a reel for thread, and between her and the princess sits a presiding four-armed deity. All these identifications were made by Stein, who also noted the petal-shaped spots of dark pink set around the figures, and compared them to the auspicious sandal-ointment marks used by Hindus. In addition the four-armed god has been identified by N. V.D’ yakonova as a patron of weaving, presiding over the Silk Legend, as on this panel, and occasionally represented separately, as in Pl. 70-2 and another panel in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad (Joanna Williams, 1973, Fig. 63). Still another panel on exhibition in the Hermitage Museum (ibid., Fig. 64) presents the same figures in a vertical composition, with the four-armed god at the top of the panel and below him the princess holding the bowl of cocoons, with a kneeling attendant holding a shuttle (?). Below that, the princess is shown once more, this time with an attendant pointing at her headdress, just as in the Stein panel reproduced here.
Yet another panel brought by Stein from Dandan-oilik, and now in New Delhi (ibid., Fig. 58, and Ancient Khotan, Pl. LXVII), displays a slightly different version of the same subject, which can be seen as an important local legend, of which the panel shown here was the first and is still the finest example.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
斯坦因在丹丹烏里克發現的木板畫中，此繪畫是最爲引人注目的作品，由於是放在地板上，保存狀態極好。發現它的丹丹烏里克D.X寺址，是一個有數層千佛壁畫以及一身塑像的小屋。現在塑像已沒有了，只剩下中間細的漏斗狀八角形台座，下面曾有放供物的寬架子，此木板畫正好靠放在台座的一面。
臉部與喀達里克壁畫的斷片一樣，主要輪廓線用紅色描繪，上瞼和眉毛上加了墨色。斯坦因認爲，此主題與養蠶技術傳到于闐的傳說故事有關。主要人物是中國公主，據玄奘的《大唐西域記》（12章）記載，于闐過去沒有桑葉，也沒有蠶，于闐王命令使者去求得桑葉和蠶，但中國禁止帶出國外。於是，她便將桑種和繭藏在頭飾中（左邊的侍女正在指著），嫁到于闐。國境的關卡不可能查到頭飾，計劃順利成功。從此于闐開始養蠶，公主前面的籃子裏盛滿了繭。
站在撐滿經線的織機旁右端的像，右手拿著與Figs. 34-35展示的相同的筬。她後邊放著紡車樣的器械，她和公主中間坐著四臂神像。斯坦因對以上進行過比定，也進一步對散落于諸像周邊的暗紅色花瓣形裝飾，和印度教的塗白檀香的吉祥標誌做了比較。另外，N. V.D’ yakonova將四臂神像與掌管養蠶的編織守護神作了比定，圖70－2和艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的另外的一塊木板畫（參照Joanna Williams《和田佛教美術圖像》，Fig. 63），是作爲獨立像描繪的。而陳列于艾爾米塔什美術館的有另外一塊木板畫，內容是縱向排列的（同上，參照Fig. 64），最上部繪著四臂像，其下是手持盛繭容器的公主和手捧梭樣器械跪著的侍女，最下段描繪的公主和指向其頭飾的侍女的樣子，與本圖木板畫中的一樣。
同樣，斯坦因從丹丹烏里克所獲現藏新德里國立博物館一塊木板畫（同上，參照Fig. 58及《古代和田》圖版LXVII）也繪有相同主題，但其表現形式略有变化，可以視爲當地的一個重要傳説。此木板畫較本圖所示的年代早，而且更爲精美。; The Department of Asia would like to thank Xanthe Carmichael for her help with updating the information on the site of Dandan-Uiliq.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.
