The box has flat ends and pierced spherical knobs at each end, originally for suspension. The box has a detachable end inserted by means of a cylindrical sheet. Each end, also octagonal, has a beaded border and the eight faces and both ends are pierced to hold stones or, now, where not empty, show organic matter which may have held the stones. Along the octagonal body oval openings, all with garnets, alternate with openings pointed at one end and with two rounded projections or lobes at the other. These, but for one with a green stone of the same shape, reveal organic matter. Except for the face with the globular suspension lugs at each end, which has three, the remaining faces each have eight openings for stones. On both ends the openings are, in the centre, circular with a garnet and surrounded concentrically with heart-shaped openings, some empty and some with organic matter. This organic matter is a resin or a gum resin, perhaps used to pad the outer and inner gold sheets of which the box is made as well as to hold the stones.

Inside the object, otherwise empty, was preserved a small piece of paper now in the archive of the Department of Oriental Antiquities and inscribed in ink as follows: ""Within this Relic Holder - found at the Ahin Posh Tope near Jellalabad were 2 gold Coins - and a small dark Substance - to me indistinguishable as to its character. But being found in the Relic Holder I am inclined to think that it was the real object for which the Case was made - I cannot suppose that the Coins were the object of presentation. - The Relic may have been worn by the person whose Ashes were in the Cell - that is perhaps the most probable theory - but if we suppose that at the Consecration of the Tope which Ceremony no doubt took place when the Relics were deposited - (see Mahawamso for consecration of Singhalese Tope or Dagoba) - and the coins were thrown in as Votive offerings - It is a possible theory that this Relic-holder may have been deposited on the Ashes with this motive, - I think that the first theory is the most likely.

The finds accompanying the amulet box consisted of what Simpson supposed were ashes, lying free, and twenty gold coins of Vima Kadphises, Kaniska, Huviska, the Roman emperors Domitian (AD 93-8) and Trajan (AD 98-117) and Hadrian's empress Julia Sabina (d. 137); the two contained in the box were of Vima and Kaniska.

Among the groups with a Bodhisattva flanked by Brahmā and Indra or other figures he sees as representing the Instigation (saṃcodana) of Siddhārtha to abandon the secular life, Foucher specifies this panel as an example, explaining the water pot as symbolising the Bodhisattva's spiritual intentions, although it does not occur on all the examples he proposes for this subject. Framed representations of a Bodhisattva with water pot are indeed found associated with narrative scenes from the Buddha's life but not in unambiguous sequences to confirm an identification.; Zwalf 1996:

Translation
A bound goat, lying to the right, with very long horns, carved out excellently and finished from a dark, translucent layer of the most beautiful and bright Indian onyx, adhering to a white opaque one elsewhere, in a most ancient work, using a hammer and scalpel, not a borer and a wheel; nevertheless so skilfully and elegantly, that Greek artists even of the best periods scarcely ever fashioned anything more genuine, beautiful, or excellent. Bridled and bound horses and bulls are known on Cretan coins and those of King Archelaus of Macedonia; and a type of goat not different to this, which has been represented on the silver coins of [text unclear]; thus I thought the work to be very ancient Greek Asiatic. Nevertheless there are those who believed rather that it was from the Indus Valley civilisation; the empire of whom, as holy as civic, was thus overthrown completely by the Brahmins, around the six hundredth year before the birth of Christ, so that we have received only few and not sufficiently certain things about this from the richly mythical traditions of each people. However, remains and fragments among the ruins of the ancient cities, that have been dug up in many places, and preserved until now, demonstrate satisfactorily enough that it was very extensive and flourishing; and more productive and more distinguished by far in terms of the cultivation of the fine arts and taste, than the empire of those who succeeded them after they had been overthrown*; nor is it unreasonable to infer that statuettes made by the art of carving out hard and precious stones of this kind, reached the Greeks from this people; with specimens and material reaching them through trade with Medes and Persians, the borders of whom used to touch those of the Indian Empire: certainly the ancient Egyptians seem never to have been versed at all in the art either of carving out or of engraving these stones; nor do the Greeks seem to have practised this before the times of the Medes, although they were by no means ignorant of the latter even in the century of [text unclear]; indigenous stones certainly provide suitable evidence of this; yet Indian, bicoloured stone were generally needed for the former; and all more ancient examples have been carved or rather hammered out, in the practice still thriving among the Indians and Persians, with tools that are undoubtedly more incomplete than a hammer and scalpel, without a wheel and borer, and have then been finished with great care. What the Phoenicians accomplished in this art form we are not able to comprehend in any way, even through a probable inference; but that they practised it must scarcely be doubted.

The distribution of the finds between London and  India was determined by specialists, appointed by the Government of India  (through the India Office, London) and the British Museum, who drew up  lists of the objects for approval by both sides.

In December 1879, the British diplomat Ernest Satow (1843-1929) visited Horyuji together with William Anderson and saw the Kondo wall-paintings. Realizing their importance, he commissioned the painter Sakurai Koun to produce a copy of wall no. 9, and this project began in May 1880. A duplicate copy was given to the head of the Museum Bureau, Machida Hisanari (1838-97), to encourage him to commission a full set of copies. Satow sent his copy of wall no. 9 to Anderson, who had returned to England in early 1880. Having formed part of the Anderson Collection at the British Museum since 1881, the drawing was rediscovered by Princess Akiko of Mikasa in 2007, during the research for her doctoral thesis.

At Amarāvatī carved slabs covered the 'stūpa' drum along the processional path where worshippers could see events from the Buddha's life and representations of the 'stūpa' itself. This drum slab shows the 'stūpa' in an elaborate form. The railing pierced by an entrance surmounted by lions obscures all but the tops of the drum slabs. The first visible register represents the drum coping; a rectangular projection with pillars occurs at the cardinal points. Two are visible at the sides with lions on the corresponding gateways. Above the drum coping are huge dome panels with crowded scenes. In fact, the drum platform projected 3.7m around the dome; no stairway is depicted and none was revealed in the excavations. Above the dome panels are registers with running animals, pots of plenty and undulating garlands which mark the beginning of the curvature; above are narrative roundels set in elaborate swags. Crowning the monument, a rectangular railing encloses a pillar and parasols. All the space beside it is filled by a dense composition of jubilant deities, one of whom is playing the flute. The scene visible in the gateway represents the Buddha, after the Enlightenment, sheltered from a storm by the serpent-spirit Mucalinda. Before him are worshippers; others flanking the gate include standing, sitting and dwarfish figures carrying offerings. The sheltering of the Buddha by Mucalinda was a little-used motif in India but became popular in Southeast Asia. There is no evidence, however, for images or panels of this apparent size below the pillared platforms, whose function is obscure. The railing of the processional path consists of uprights, a coping and crossbars with prominent lotus roundels, and projecting on both sides of the gateway are the tops of pillars standing in the processional path.
However inaccurate it may be in minor or even major features, this slab shows the splendour of an eastern Deccani 'stūpa' at its most ornate.; Bibliography:

Unlike the sometimes fantastic Gandharan narrative scenes where the Buddha is assaulted by the rejected Māra's army of monsters, this Sārnāth representation is more an icon with dominant central cult figure. Instead of the heavy-lidded Sārnāth introspection there is here an apt, if serene, awareness of triumph as monsters hover over the Buddha while Māra and a daughter stand beside him. The apparently rocky ground beneath may show not only the discomfited followers of Māra tumbling when the earth shook at the Buddha's summons but also the earth goddess emerging to bear witness.","Williams 1982 / The Art of Gupta India: Empire and Province; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Willis 1999 / Tibet: Life, Myth and Art; Willis 2014 / The Dhanesar Kherā Buddha in the British Museum and the ‘Politische Strukturen’ of the Gupta Kingdom in India (7th century); Siudmak 2013 / The Hindu-Buddhist Sculpture of Ancient Kashmir and its Influence",Not on display,"Exhibited:

It was removed from the Buddhist Himalayas (probably Tibet) in the 1950s or 60s. Its precise findspot and circumstances of acquisition are not known (see von Schroeder 1981, 208). It was first owned by a Belgian yachtsman, George Plouvier of Antwerp, owner of the J-Class Yacht Calabria (a.k.a. Lillas). Plouvier (d. 1972) sold it in 1968 to Baron Frederic (Freddy) Rolin (1919-2001) of Grez-Doiceau, Belgium.  Baron Rolin was a collector of ethnographic art and the owner of the recently (early 2004) identified small portrait of a woman by Vermeer. The Buddha was bought in 1982 by Mr Jeff Soreff of New York. It was then sold to Mr George Ortiz, and subsequently purchased jointly by the BM and V&A in March 2004.

(Object),,,"Panel showing the Buddha preaching between two Bodhisattvas. The Buddha sits, the drapery folding grooved and paired. The head is globular and the wavy hair forms successive bands from ear to ear into the uṣṇīṣa, which is secured by a fillet. The face is flat, the eyes long and oblique with heavy projecting lids. The ears are close to the head and the ūrṇā a large incised circle. The thumb and index finger of the lower hand join and touch the bottom of the upper hand; the other fingers bend inwards but also join the bottom of the upper hand. The Buddha's seat has radiating stamens and centrally grooved, double-outlined petals. Behind the Buddha, in low relief, is a plain rectangular throne back with a large halo above.
Originally two worshippers knelt, hands joined, beside the lotus base. The surviving figure wears an uttarīya and has a hairstyle of wide and curled vertical bands. Flanking the Buddha himself stand two haloed Bodhisattvas with plump faces and long narrow eyes below heavy, sharply cut lids. Both wear the uttarīya in the wide mode, and the drapery folds are mainly in paired grooves. Both have collars and necklaces with a central ornament, earrings and bracelets; the figure on the Buddha's right wears a crested turban with retaining bands; the other, Maitreya, has a small double-looped chignon with a pointed ornament in front and a beaded diadem below. Both hold the right hand to shoulder level, and where it survives, in the case of Maitreya, palm inwards. The turbaned figure holds the left hand on the hip; Maitreya is turned away, except for the head, and holds a damaged water pot; on his right upper arm is the vestige of an armlet. Above each figure a parasol, with a small festoon at the edge and pendent garlands, appears to support a Buddha in 'dhyānamudra', hands wrapped, in the surviving instance with an oval head and protruding rounded eyes. These Buddhas, their robes showing paired grooves, are seated against a nimbus and aureole. At the top, between them, is a canopy of three flowers with acanthus-like petals and what must have been a beaded garland in their centres. Below the Buddha the remains of a register show three Buddhas each seated on a similar lotus in 'dhyānamudra' with hands covered, one with his head turned inwards.

According to the inscription on the base, it was dedicated to the Chongguang Temple 崇光寺 in Hancui village 韓崔村 in AD585. Both the temple and the village can no longer be identified, but it is thought that the location was south-west of Baoding 保定 in Hebei province, a region known for its white marble sculptures. 
Buddhism was slowly introduced into China from first century AD and was widespread during the period of division from second to sixth century AD. After achieving the reunification of much of China by AD 581, the two emperors of the Sui dynasty (AD 581-618), both devout Buddhists, made Buddhism a state religion. Amitābha, literally meaning boundless light in Sanskrit, is the principal Buddha of the Pure Land sect 淨土宗 popular in China in the sixth to seventh centuries. 
Almost 8m high, this statue is comparable in size with figures carved in the rock at the Buddhist cave temples of central China from the 5th-7th centuries. During this period, Chinese Buddhist sculpture underwent a transition in style. The earliest stylised images gave way to a greater naturalism, characterised with anatomically credible bodies, probably influenced by the art of Gupta India.
The hands of the statue are missing but the right hand would have been 		raised, palm outwards in the gesture of fearlessness (abhaya mudrā),  and 		the left hand lowered in the gesture of wish-granting (varada mudrā).
A joint and a polished work surface at the waist show that the statue was carved in two separate parts. 
Traces of pigments on more than one location on the surface suggest that the statue was once covered with gilding and colours. 
Buddhist figures often sit or stand on a lotus. Lotuses, as symbols  of purity, enlightenment and divine birth, are an important image in  Buddhist art.

The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces.

The folds are usually arranged according to two basic rules: the folds above the middle are generally centred on the right side of the body, and those downwards from it are distributed along a vertical line between the legs.
Two recurrent features of the draped Buddha image relate to the fall of the drapery, which can be represented as cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it (see 1947.0511.1), or as an edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow, which goes along the left forearm and is held to secure the robes in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped from the first layer of cloth (the undergarment), usually appears looped (see 1899.0715.1).",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and exfoliated.

The two schemes mentioned relate to the arrangement of the drapery folds on the over-robe or outer-garment of Gandharan standing Buddha figures. There are two types of folds: major and minor folds. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them there may be minor folds, usually thin ribs in very low relief. The alternation of major and minor folds may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1), or may be concentrated on the upper part of the body (see 1899.0715.1). There are also sculptures where the minor folds are almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11). The folds are usually arranged according to two basic rules: the folds above the middle are generally centred on the right side of the body, and those downwards from it are distributed along a vertical line between the legs.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and with soil incrustation.

This, the oldest Nepalese image in the British Museum, is executed in the Gupta tradition that was well represented in the Nepal valley, but the treatment of mass is more summary in ways that recall developments in Bihar during the pre-Pala period (c.

The haloed and seated Buddha wears the over-robe leaving his right shoulder and feet bare and an undergarment visible below his right shoulder; it lies on the seat beside a fall of gathered drapery from his left wrist which spreads out. The drapery folds are defined mainly by paired grooves separating broad flat strips. The head is a long and regular oval; the hair, representing the Indian snail-shell curl tradition, consists of a series of beaded rows running from side to side and concentric on the uṣṇīṣa. The eyes are rounded and open with prominent lids under gently rounded brows, and there is no ūrṇā. The nose is broad, the mouth shaped, the chin prominent and the concave ears stand out symmetrically. The hands have long fluid fingers, the left index and middle fingers touching the bottom of the right hand in the preaching gesture. The Buddha's seat is the top of an obconical gynoecium tapering into a lotus with two downturned rows of plain petals, the lower row showing another beneath.
The Bodhisattva on the Buddha's left wears a patterned collar and a necklace with a plain strand and one of beads, and the uttarīya loops in the narrow mode. His left hand holds a damaged garland and his right may have been in 'abhayamudra'. The turban has a large crest and tapering central ornament, and retaining bands radiate from below it. The face is oval and long with long, narrow, low-lidded eyes and a long, straight, rather prominent mouth. The earrings have pendent beads. The other Bodhisattva, presumably Maitreya, wears a similar collar and necklace, a cord with a crescentic amulet and three or four boxes, one cylindrical, paridhāna and uttarīya with paired grooves for folds and worn in the wide mode; a water pot was probably held in his lost left hand. Most of his right forearm is lost; the hand may have been in 'abhayamudra' or turned palm inwards. He wears a diadem, earrings with beaded hoop and a horizontal length of hair, knotted over a chignon and looped on one side. His face, similar to that of the other Bodhisattva, is more gently rounded. Both Bodhisattvas lack the ūrṇā, are haloed and stand on feet with long toes on a lotus pedestal like the Buddha's; one lotus also has a short stalk. The three haloes overlap.
Below the Buddha an incense-burner or lamp (showing flames rather than smoke) on a columnar stand is flanked by a worshipper with knee-length tunic, ornamented trousers, moustache, two horizontal rows of curls over the forehead,
vertical bands of curls above and a chignon, kneeling with hands joined while a woman with a prominent band of hair in front and a loop of hair behind kneels opposite; she wears armlets, bracelets, earrings, collar, a tunic, a cloak gathered over her right leg and a scarf. Both have small, protruding, rounded eyes.
Above the haloes may be the remains of flying figures bearing a crown or garland.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Jamalgarhi,stone,,,carved,Diameter: 9.70 centimetres; Height: 40.60 centimetres; Width: 27.30 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
Relatively simple triads of a seated Buddha preaching and flanked by more or less frontal standing Bodhisattvas have been grouped with more complicated, densely inhabited and sometimes architecturally very ornate panels, often with the same Bodhisattvas less prominent, standing or seated, also flanking a preaching Buddha. The Bodhisattva with a water pot is generally accepted as Maitreya but the opposite, turbaned figure is still subject to discussion. Either Bodhisattva may stand on the Buddha's right and can also vary in iconographic detail: both may hold the right hand in 'abhayamudra', but Maitreya may turn the palm inwards, or hold a lotus instead, and the turbaned figure may hold a lotus or garland in his left hand. All too often the hands and attributes are lost. The Buddha usually sits on an open lotus which may, as here, have petals turned down or pointing upwards and sometimes a stalk below rising out of water. Many other details vary.
This group was interpreted, following Divyāvadāna XII, as representing the multiplication aspect of the Miracle of Śrāvastī, the kneeling persons as Lūhasudatta and his wife and the flanking figures as Indra and Brahmā. Subsequent interpretations have been as 'ordinary worshipping scenes' with Bodhisattvas, as a general theophany symbolising immanence and power, as a revelation of doctrine to assemblies as in the Mahāyāna sūtras and as paradisiacal relief scenes with Amitābha in certain instances as the central Buddha. In an unpublished study Filigenzi sees the triads as simplified versions, appropriate for more personal worship, of the more complex theophanies which she interprets as manifestations of the saṃbhogakāya or divine principle as Buddha revealed to Bodhisattvas; while the flanking Bodhisattva with water pot is Maitreya, she sees the turbaned Bodhisattva as Avalokiteśvara and proposes varieties of solar iconography to identify him in Gandhāra. In another unpublished study, which draws much on work in Japanese, Rhi argues in detail against many of the past interpretations but believes it possible, judging iconographically, that what he has called preaching Buddha panels were an early representation of Śākyamuni and the Bodhisattvas Siddhārtha and Maitreya combined without specific textual sanction and offered for reasons of economy on a single relief instead of by means of separate statuary disposed in chapels; complex and later instances, where Avalokiteśvara may have replaced Siddhārtha, in his opinion reflect Śākyamuni expounding in structures and assemblies and exhibit a ritual elaboration drawn from the holding of festivals and processions.; Zwalf 1985
This slab with its worshippers in foreign dress beside a fire altar may be an icon of developing Buddhism. The central Buddha, flanked by Bodhisattvas and preaching, can be seen as expounding fresh doctrine as in many Mahāyāna ‘sūtras’. The Bodhisattvas are, on the left, Maitreya, since his distinguishing flask is almost preserved and, on the right, perhaps Avalokiteśvara, though he lacks the Buddha figure in the head-dress occasionally seen in Gandharan sculptures also in this context. This is an early example of the triads of Buddhas flanked by Bodhisattvas that became common later.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Shimada and Willis 2016 / Amaravati: The Art of an Early Buddhist Monument in Context,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The haloed Buddha, his body in three-quarter view but with the head almost in profile, stands in a crescentic curve, the overrobe covering both shoulders and the raised neckline evenly curving. He raises one hand with the palm partly inwards, while the other hand secures the robe at waist level. His eyes are open; the hair undulates into the small uṣṇīṣa and the halo has a narrow border. Behind the Buddha stands a Vajrapāṇi, a rounded vajra at his shoulder; he appears rather like a rustic or ascetic with a large nose and bulbous eyes, abundantly bearded, full-bellied and wearing a short paridhāna with a thick girdle (uttarīya).
In a small fenced tank in front of the Buddha three figures, each with a serpent rising from behind, join their hands. The first, male, has a five-headed serpent, and wears a crested turban with large globular ornament and an uttarīya; the second, a female, wears a sleeved tunic and another garment from her left shoulder, a necklace, earring, bracelet, a wreath headdress and flower in the hair beneath a single rearing serpent; the third, also female, similarly dressed and under a single serpent, turns to look in dread over her shoulder at another Vajrapāṇi. The rectangular tank is enclosed by a plain wall with a rocky terrain at its foot and mouldings with sawtooth enrichment beneath a vedikā of plain, worn uprights crossed by bars of curved section under a coping with sawtooth enrichment. Low down on the side facing the Buddha a spout in the form of a lion's head appears to emit water.
Beside and above the tank, small rounded bluffs with patches of vegetation conveyed by radiating lines indicate mountainous terrain (see BM 1902.1002.18) which appears to oversail the tank. Within it a muscular Vajrapāṇi, of less rustic and more threatening expression than the other, stands with one foot on a higher ledge, both arms stretched out, one holding a flattened faceted vajra.
The scene has on both sides a pilaster with, on the shaft, a long, narrow, recessed oblong panel curved at the top and bottom. It has a rectangular Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts and the usual base; its prominent plinth and torus seem parts of the complex lower frame. Above one pilaster a voluted double-bracket capital survives with sawtooth enrichment. On the right is a crenellated bastion with slanting returning walls, rectangular and pointed loopholes and a wall above receding according to a form of perspective. Beyond the left-hand pilaster two figures are separated by a tree; one may be a woman in a tunic and paridhāna without ornaments who is holding (receiving) a bowl in one or both hands; the other, facing, a male figure possibly with a crested turban, a paridhāna and a twisted scarf wound twice across the torso, seems to stretch out one hand under the bowl and with the other appears to hold the hilt of a sword. Behind is another tree.

Only sources in translation now give an account of a dragon of Swat named  Apalāla who, with his wife and children, ravaged the crops and was brought into submission by the Buddha, in some instances with the vigorous help of Vajrapāṇi. Originally situated in Magadha, this event became associated with the Buddha's legendary travels in the Northwest and acquired a local importance.
The appearance of the second and aggressive Vajrapāṇi assaulting the nāga and his family, to all appearances in continuous narration, is explained by Foucher (1905-51: I, 550-3) as an adaptation of the composition used for the subject of BM 1880.196.

The standing figure holds his robe in the lower left hand; the right hand, now missing, was originally raised in abhaya mudrā; part of the halo is missing on the right side, feet also missing; set in on a sandstone block.
The low neckline has a clearly distinguishable backthrow; this refers to that part of the robe which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped. The major folds, dense terraces and ridges, in varied relief and especially high between the legs, are rendered in two schemes on clinging drapery. The head is round to oval, with dense curving hair continuing from a peak into the uṣṇīṣa, which is partly flat at the top and deeply drawn in at its base, and has no visible band except for a small disc aligned with the ūrṇā and peak. There are small curls in higher relief beside the short projecting ears, which are slightly concave and have grooved lobes. The forehead is narrow and modelled. The eyebrows have a gently curving edge above a modelled slope to the open eyes, which have narrow lids over flat eyeballs. The small mouth is surmounted by a moustache, and the chin is full and well-formed.
The head is angled downwards and was centred on the halo by a short vertical line above the uṣṇīṣa. The breasts are rounded, with a nipple visible through the robes on the left, and the abdomen hardly protrudes. There are shallow grooved lines round the neck, and below the right shoulder a rough surface survives from a strut for the 'abhaya' hand. The left hand is somewhat large, with long fluid fingers and nails, and secures the robe by a small loop of its drapery.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan);  Made in: Pakistan,Found/Acquired: Takht-i-Bahi,schist,,,carved,Height: 103 centimetres; Weight: 40 kilograms approx ; Width: 32 centimetres; Depth: 22.50 centimetres,,"Zwalf, 1996:
Two recurrent features of the draped Buddha image relate to the fall of the drapery, which can be represented as cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it (see 1947.0511.1), or as an edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow (that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped), which goes along the left forearm and is held to secure the robes in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped from the first layer of cloth (the undergarment), usually appears looped, as in this figure.
For this early type see Marshall, 1960: 61, referring to similar figures as 'the earliest of their kind', and plus 58-9, figs 85-6. For other similar types see Peshawar 2086 (Tissot, 1985a: fig. 149); Berlin MIK 1 44, 114, 527; Cleveland 72.43, dated (Czuma, 1985: no. 107) to the second half of the 2nd century.; Zwalf 1985
The angle of the right forearm and rough projection at the armpit where a strut supported the lost hand show that this Buddha was in the gesture of reassurance, offering protection to the worshipper. The left hand holds an end of cloth from the robe, and the lower undergarment can be seen above the lost feet. There is a noticeable moustache on the upper lip, and the broken halo has traces of an ancient repair. In type this Buddha is reminiscent of that on the Kaniṣka coin (no. 121).",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Koezuka (1994) / Masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu Art from the British Museum; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The major and some of the minor drapery folds are thick rounded ridges and terraces. The upturned feet are hidden under the drapery, except on the Buddha's right.

The head is oval and the wavy hair is drawn back in locks of varying relief, which curve in crescents to each side forming a pointed oval above the peak, and continue into the uṣṇīṣa which is secured at its base by a thin twisted band. The modelled face is fleshy. The ūrṇā lies in a depression of the forehead; the eyebrows, a distinct arched edge above the lightly convex slope to the eyes, continue more sharply onto the bridge of the nose; and the horizontal eyes have upper lids with sharp edges over rounded eyeballs. The mouth, with shaped lips, has a projecting upper lip suggesting a moustache. The chin is full and the concave ears, with a deep oval recess in the lobes, are set close to the head.
The breasts and abdomen are gently rounded. The right leg is flexed at the knee and the weight of the body is on the left leg. Where visible, the legs are columnar and without modelling, and the feet have long toes with nails and ridges for knuckles. The backplate, with a vertical reinforcing ridge between the legs, is rounded at the sides.
A short upper undergarment is visible under one of the arms and another longer undergarment hangs as far as the ankles. An effect of wet drapery on this Buddha, especially on the shoulders, is nearly lost under the dense folds.

On his right are two worshipping monks, and opposite a donor couple; all with small, rounded eyes and paired grooves for drapery folds. The monks have bare right shoulders and join their hands.

The raised right arm and distinct backthrow (that part of the robe which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped) on the somewhat thick, plunging neckline result in the usual two schemes of drapery folds on the overrobe of the standing Buddha image. According to these schemes, curves above the middle are centred on the right side of the body and those downwards from it along a vertical line between the legs. The major folds may consist of usually rounded ridges in varying relief, which may also be a little undercut from above to form shallow pockets, as here, and more mechanically distributed terraces. In between them may be minor folds, usually a thin rib in very low relief; as on the present figure the alternation may continue down the whole body (see 1889.1109.1 and 1961.0519.1); in other cases  it is concentrated in the upper body (see 1899.0715.1 or 1940.0713.8); and the minor folds may also be almost wholly absent (see 1902.1002.11). Two other recurrent features of the draped Buddha image are the more or less thick fall of drapery, representing cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it, here dense and ending in meandering edges, and the edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow drawn along and under the left forearm and held to secure the robes more thoroughly in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped before draping, usually appears looped (see 1950.1211.6).",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/od),,"1.

Errington: Masson records excavating a mound at the entrance to Khol Shams, south of Kabul, in 1833 (1842, vol.3, pp.93-6). He found an 'arched recess, ornamentally carved, and supported by two slender pillars. In it [were] the remains of several earthen images; the heads of the two larger ones only were sufficiently entire to bear removal. They were evidently of female figures, and of very regular and handsome features ... slight traces ascertain that the figures had been originally covered with layers of white and red paint, and that over the latter had been placed a surface of gold leaf. The hair of the heads, tastefully arranged in curls, had been painted with an azure colour. The recess also had been embellished with gold leaf and lapis lazuli tints'. The two heads, and fragments of a birch bark manuscript from the site (see 1880.3891.b) were dispatched from Kabul, together with 8 stucco Buddha heads from Hadda (see 1880.107, 109-119, 121) in December 1834 (MSS Eur. E 161/VII, f.22), finally arriving in London in mid 1837 (Errington 2006, pp.90, 92, n.28).
Although no documentation linking this head and 1880.122 to Masson or the India Museum appears to survive, the likelihood of their being the two from Khol Shams is reinforced by the following points. We know that the heads reached the India Museum with the rest of the 1834 shipment in 1837. 1880.106 and 1880.122 are the only two clay objects without provenance in the collection that fit the description of the missing heads: 1880.122 appears to be the head of a woman and, at the time of excavation, Masson did not realise the Buddhist nature of his finds and routinely describes Buddha heads as female. Painted clay figures of the 4th-5th century and later predominate at Hadda and sites around Kabul, Zwalf (above) notes the stylistic affinity between this head and 1880.110-112, 1880.117 acquired by Masson at Hadda. There are even stronger links with the painted clay statues from the neighbouring Kabul site of Tepe Marinjan (see F.

This appears to reverse the usual direction taken by the backthrow.

Although metal technology from tool-making to the abundant minting of a money economy was clearly well understood, Buddhist metal sculpture has proved elusive, with the examples known today being few, of modest size and mainly late. See also 1981.0610.1.
There is little modelling of the body. The abdomen and the back hindquarters can be distinguished under the fall of the robe, but the breasts are hardly indicated. The Buddha's stance is not wholly frontal: his right side has a forward movement, perhaps once enhanced by the lost hand as well as by the flexed leg. The face is most individual. Despite its youthful character, the long flat nose and the quite horizontal line of the eyes give it an unusual severity, examples of which can, however, also be found in later work in stone and in the stucco tradition. The face of an incomplete stucco figure, perhaps of a deity or bodhisattva (1887.0717.78), shows a great similarity, although executed in a much freer way and lacking the severity of gesture appreciated here.
The term ‘backthrow’ refers to that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped.
 
The precise metal composition of the figure can be found in ""Indo-Tibetan bronzes"" by von Schroeder, published in 1981 (p. 80).; Zwalf 1985
Presumably once making the gesture of reassurance, this rare example of a Gandharan bronze has a face of great individuality with its youthful open-eyed expression recalling the vivid later stucco sculptures. The ridged garment continues the Western realism in the Gandharan treatment of drapery but also contributes, with the large feet and hands, to a certain heaviness. If the dimensions were sufficient proof, this bronze might be one found by Cunningham at Mānikyāla.; Rawson 1992:
In Gandhara the Buddha was portrayed in his human form, not symbolically as had been the custom earlier in the Indian subcontinent. This image is a typical example and this model was adapted by the Chinese for their earliest images of the Buddha: the first Chinese bronze figures display the same U-shaped folds.
The very first Buddhist images in China had appeared only as incidental ornaments in tombs, mirrors and ceramics. In such contexts, they were equated with depictions of such spirits as the Queen Mother of the West. Under Chinese rule Buddhism was absorbed alongside other religious beliefs. Only under the rule of outsiders, from the fourth to the sixth century AD, such as the Liang in Gansu province and the Toba tribes (who took the title of Wei when they occupied North China), did Buddhism enjoy substantial imperial patronage. These foreign rulers encouraged the making of images in both stone and metal, including bronze, gold and silver.",von Schroeder 1981 / Indo-Tibetan Bronzes; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Rawson 1992 / The British Museum Book of Chinese Art; The Times 1959,On display (G33/dc51a/s1),"Exhibited:

The full, rather fleshy features prominent on several heads, especially 1880.112, 1880.110, 1880.111 and 1880.117, suggest Gupta influence and a late date.

He describes the Buddha figures as c. 15-20 cm in height, comprising 'a strong cast head fixed on a body of earth, whence the heads only can be brought away. They are seated and clothed in folds of drapery, and the hair is woven into rows of curls.

The snail-shell curls are formed of originally applied and incised small discs continued into the large uṣṇīṣa and forming a peak over the forehead. Incised brows form wide arches over long and protruding globular eyes under low lids; the nose is straight with a sharp ridge; and the shaped mouth, with a fuller lower lip, is set into the broad lower face above a full chin. The damaged ears are close to the head and probably had long lobes.
The backplate has the form of an aureole combining a mandorla and nimbus. It is outlined with a foliate band and with radiating projections formed of a circular bead and a pointed drop or leaf, both with a border, ending in three plain circular beads. Traces of dotted and continuous lines on the front of a metal strip at the base of the backplate suggest the presence of an inscription.",,,,,,,Kushan,5thC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Sahri Bahlol,brass,,,cast,"Height: 5 centimetres base only ; Height: 27.80 centimetres figure only ; Height: 31.50 centimetres mandala only ; Height: 36 centimetres on base ; Weight: 3.30 kilograms; Width: 14.70 centimetres base only ; Width: 10 centimetres figure only ; Width: 18.70 centimetres mandala only ; Width: 18.70 centimetres on base ; Depth: 10.90 centimetres base only ; Depth: 6.80 centimetres figure only ; Depth: 1.70 centimetres mandala only ; Depth: 10.90 centimetres on base ","Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: base of the backplate Inscription note: The inscription was first reported in Errington and Cribb, 1992: 218, with readings of single ""akṣaras"".","Zwalf 1996:
Although metal technology from tool-making to the abundant minting of a money economy was clearly well understood, Buddhist metal sculpture has proved elusive, with the examples known today being few, of modest size and mainly late. See also 1958.0714.1.
The face may be compared with others of the stucco tradition and Gupta-period Mathura Buddhas.
The term ‘backthrow’ refers to that part of the over-robe or outer-garment which is thrown over the left shoulder after the body has been draped. Two recurrent features of the draped Buddha image relate to the fall of the drapery, which can be represented as cloth gathered over the left wrist and falling from it (see 1947.0511.1), or as an edge under the length of the left forearm. This edge represents the backthrow, which goes along the left forearm and is held to secure the robes in the left hand by a corner which, together with a corner grasped from the first layer of cloth (the undergarment), usually appears looped (see 1899.0715.1).; Zwalf 1985
This very different example from the few surviving Gandharan bronzes belongs to a group from a single findspot and perhaps atelier. The ridged drapery is very conventional, and the face recalls not only the later Gandharan stucco sculpture but, even farther afield, Gupta-period Buddhas from central India such as that from Mankuwar dated to AD 448-9 (or 429). The backplate, common to the whole group, has a radiating ornament which appears early in Gandhara, but its closest resemblance is with painting dated to the 7th century.","von Schroeder 1981 / Indo-Tibetan Bronzes; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Errington & Cribb 1992 / The Crossroads of Asia  [Cat. of an exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge]; Koezuka (1994) / Masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu Art from the British Museum; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum",On display (G33/dc51b/s3),"Exhibited:

From Whitfield 1985:
The great stupa at Rawak was one of the most important sites investigated by Stein on his first journey. Lying to the north of Khotan, high sand dunes helped to preserve it while subsoil water had destroyed the timbers that served to support its sculptures. The plan (see Ancient Khotan, Pl.XL) shows a vihāra court 161 feet (49.1 m)long by 141 feet (43.0m)wide, within which rose a stupa in three storeys, the lowest some 78 feet (23.8m)square. The stupa was approached by a staircase in the centre of each side; its summit, as measured by Stein, was some 23 1/2 feet (7.1m) above the floor of the court. The enclosing wall of this vihāra court was adorned, both inside and outside, with rows of colossal statues in clay stucco, supported on a wooden framework, which had completely disappeared. 
Because of the friable nature of the material, it was not possible for Stein to recover any of the larger figures intact: “All that could be done in the case of these large sculptures was to bury them again safely in the sand after they had been photographed and described” (Ancient Khotan, Vol.Ⅰ, p.502). The stupa and some of the very numerous statues lining the inner and outer walls of the stupa court are shown in Ancient Khotan (Figs.59-69), and other photographs from Emil Trinkler’s investigation of the site in 1927-28  are published by Gerd Gropp (1974, Figs.93-111 and Pls.XIII-XVIII). All of these show the magnificent scale of the whole sculptural arrangement, with larger than life-size standing figures of the Buddha alternating with smaller Buddha and Bodhisattva figures, some of them seated. The relatively small areas of wall in between the large relief figures were plastered and bore wall paintings of smaller figures, some of these probably being later additions (see Ancient Khotan, Vol.Ⅰ, p.492). 
The head shown here is from R. vi, one of the smaller Buddha figures on the inner south-west wall, standing between colossal Buddhas: the figure was broken by the fall of one of these(R. v, shown in Ancient Khotan, Fig.61) after it had been exposed for a day, but the head had been removed first and so survived. According to Stein, it was“in respect of pose, size and drapery a replica of the Buddha image R. ii. ”This figure, also visible in Fig.61 and, with its head in place, in Fig.69 of Ancient Khotan, was described by Stein in some detail (ibid., Vol. Ⅰ, pp.490-91). The form of the body is clearly visible, very narrow waisted and with swelling hips, beneath the drapery. As in the Gupta style, the drapery runs in raised lines over the smooth forms underneath, but here the lines are close-set and form stylised waves running down the figure from the neck-line. Behind the head, the nimbus was arranged in similar fashion to those reproduced by Gropp (1974, Figs.101, 103, 110) with a border of large overlapping spiral cloud scrolls, and a pointed flame extension at the top. Small seated appliqué figures of the Buddha, one at the top and two more on each side of the head, were set within the nimbus. The small appliqué seated Buddha in Pl.65 was intended for such a purpose, and is very similar, though it came from a different statue, R.lxxxiv. 
Although small in size compared with the largest figures, this head displays their principal characteristics. The whole face below the hairline is modelled in smooth curves, with very slight transitions between planes: in profile the eyebrows mark such a shift with little more than an incised line, and the small chin protrudes only slightly from the surrounding area. The eyes are sharply defined and are additionally modelled by a thick white application of stucco along the edges of the upper and lower lids. Little evidence remains of the original whitewash which probably covered the figure. Stein was able to describe a pink tīkā in the centre of the forehead, now difficult to distinguish. At the back of the head, a rectangular hollow almost the full width of the head marks the size of the supporting member of the timber framework behind the figure.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
熱瓦克塔是斯坦因第一次考古探險時發現的非常重要的遺跡之一。遺跡位於和闐北部，由於地下水的緣故支撐雕像群的木材已經腐蝕，然而厚厚的沙丘使它保存至今。據平面圖（參照《古代和闐》圖XL），寺址是49.1×43.0m的長方形，中央建有三層方塔，塔基邊長約23.8m。塔的各面中央設有臺階，據斯坦因測量，離地面約7.1m高。寺址四周圍牆的內外兩側都塑有聖像，莊嚴肅穆。最初支撐著的木架現在完全散落。
這些聖像質地脆弱易壞，斯坦因不可能完整地帶走較大的塑像。他說“我們拍照攝影和調查記錄工作結束後，只能把這些大塑像安全地埋回沙漠了”（《古代和闐》，卷1，502頁）。有關該塔和寺址圍牆內外側的塑像，除了《古代和闐》（圖59～69）外，Gerd Gropp出版的1927～1928年Emil Trinkler在此遺跡進行調查時所拍照片（《中國新疆•和闐考古發現》，1974，圖93～111及圖XIII-XVIII）中也有收錄。由此可瞭解造像規模之大，其中有比人高的立佛像，也有小一點的佛及菩薩塑像，有些是坐著的。在大佛像之間極狹窄的壁面上，塗上灰泥，繪有小的圖像，但其中有不少是後來加上的（見《古代和闐》，卷1，492頁）。
本圖所示的佛像頭部，是西南壁內側巨像間站立的一小佛像的頭部（R.vi）。此像因一身巨佛像的癱倒而毀壞（R.v，見《古代和闐》，圖61），由於風吹日曬，致使頭部與軀幹分離而殘存下來。依據斯坦因的說法，此像從“姿態、尺寸和衣紋等方面看，是R.vii佛像的複製品”。《古代和闐》的插圖61和69可以看到該像的全貌，斯坦因也作了詳細的記述（參照同書的490～491頁）。通過衣紋可清楚看到其體型為細腰肥臀Gupta風格的佛像。衣紋的線條隆起，柔順地覆蓋著身體，各個線條的間隔狹窄，形成波浪狀，從領口順著身體往下垂。頭部後面與Gropp（《中國新疆•和闐考古學發現》，1974，圖101，103，110）的形式一樣，旋渦狀的雲紋重合在大型帶狀紋的寶珠形項光上。在頭頂上和頭的兩側各貼一身小化佛。圖65的小佛就和這個小化佛一樣，儘管來自不同的塑像R.lxxxiv。
雖然尺寸與大的造像相比要少得多，但此像頭部也展示了其主要特徵。臉部前額的髮際刻板地往下拉，五官只有極小的起伏。即使從側面看，也只有一些微小的變化，眉毛只是稍有塌陷的刻線，下巴比其他部位稍微突起。眼睛很大，很清楚，上下眼瞼合在一起，貼著厚厚的白色睫毛。當初大概所有佛像都用白灰塗飾過，現在幾乎沒有痕跡了。在斯坦因記錄中，額中央還有粉色的白毫，但現在卻無法辨清。從頭像背後幾乎與頭尺寸相等的長方形凹槽可以想像原先支撐雕像木架之大。; Zwalf 1985
The great ‘stūpa’ at Rawak, north of Khotan, was surrounded by a large ‘vihāra’ court, 49.1 m by 43m. Considerable parts of the enclosing wall, adorned with images on both its faces, were preserved beneath the sand. These figures, many of them colossal, were of unfired clay supported on a timber framework, which had rotted away, so that some of the smaller heads alone could be removed. The present head is from one of the smaller Buddhas standing between colossal Buddhas on the inner south-east wall. The body of a similar figure visible in Stein's photographs is narrow-waisted, with thin drapery in narrow raised lines, as in Gupta sculptures.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith",Not on display,,,buddha; 佛 (Chinese),Representation of: Buddha;  Representation of: 佛陀,,,,,,,,1907,"The 1907-11-11 group refers to objects from Stein's First Central Asian  Expedition, 1900-01.

From Whitfield 1985:
The remains of the Miran vihara M. Ⅱ, as described by Stein (Serindia, Vol. I, p. 487), consisted of a solid mound of sun-dried bricks, in two storeys, with a base 46 by 36 feet (about 13.8 by 10.8 m) and a second storey, badly decayed, 17 by 15 2/1 feet (5.1 by 4.65m). A passage about 10 feet (3 m) wide enclosed the central portion of the shrine, and was lined along the outer wall with a row of colossal seated images of the Buddha, each measuring 7 feet to 7 feet 3 inches (about 2.1m) across the knees, and all in dhyana-mudra. Of these only the bases, hands and legs were preserved, but the head seen here had been protected through falling into the space, wider at the back than at the front, between two of these figures. It originally belonged to the third of five figures uncovered by Stein.
Although the head itself evidently cannot provide a firm basis for dating, evidence of various kinds noted by Stein leads to the date given here. The drapery over the knees of the figures was arranged as at Gandhara, with three concentric folds falling from the hands. The folds on two of the statues were in the form of boldly raised plaits about an inch (2.5cm) wide and on the other three, including this one, as narrow double grooves. There were traces of red colour, similar to the statues from Rawak. Further evidence came from the shape of the Indo-Persian stucco pilasters around the vihara base. These also show Gandharan features and must have taken time to develop into the forms seen later at Endere and Khadalik. Probably the most conclusive evidence for the dating of the Miran vihara is provided by the finding of a palm leaf pothi in Sanskrit, written in Brahmi characters of an early Gupta type, which cannot be later than the fifth century A.D., and by the corresponding absence of any relics of Tibetan writing (in contrast to Endere and Khadalik, where Tibetan documents were found in abundance).; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
據斯坦因記述（參照《西域》487頁），米蘭寺院遺迹的第Ⅱ寺址是用曬乾的磚建造的結實的兩層建築物，第一層爲13.8m×10.8m，第二層爲5.1m×4.65m。正殿中心部分圍有寬3米的回廊，沿其外壁，排列著約有2.1米的巨大坐佛，手結定印。現還殘留著那些台座、手、腳。而本圖所示的頭部，不是在像與像間的前方，而是落在空間稍寬的後方，才得以保留下來。這是斯坦因發掘的五身當中的第三尊。
佛頭本身沒有任何提示確切年代的證據，但從斯坦因所記述的以下種種特徵，能夠推算它的年代。即蓋在佛像膝蓋上的衣紋線，是從兩手垂下的三條衣褶的集合點，此是犍陀羅式的。佛像其中的兩身上約有2.5釐米寬的粗褶子，包括本像在內的三身像上，有兩條狹窄的溝狀褶子，殘留著與熱瓦克出土的塑像群相似的紅色痕迹等。另外，更明確的證據是，還可舉出圍繞寺院部位的印度、波斯風格的灰泥壁柱形狀。它們具備犍陀羅的特徵，後又向安得悅和喀達里克見到的形式發展的。對米蘭寺院遺迹的年代判斷上，最具決定性的證據是，梵文貝葉的發現。那是用笈多王朝早期的婆羅謎文寫的，不可能晚於5世紀以後。另外，從完全沒有發現吐蕃文資料這一點上也應得到證實（與安得悅和喀達里克發現大量吐蕃文書形成對比）。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

The use of moulds to produce parts of larger figures was widespread in Central Asia. At Dunhuang and elsewhere small elements such as groups of curls or locks of hair, to be applied to the head of a large figure, or for decorative borders, are common. On the northern route at Mingoi some of the shrines contained hundreds of moulded figures forming narrative tableaux. Basic types could be given individual character after moulding by modelling or applying further moulded details. At Dunhuang and elsewhere in China, the practice was paralleled in wall-painting by the use of stencils to produce images in regular series, to be distinguished by painting in different colours.","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
Shrine xv of the Ming-oi shrines was “a plain cella about 12 feet square” and, like the other shrines, had suffered damage by fire; but in it Stein discovered both some fine pieces of wood carving (Pls. 114-15) and, among other examples of stucco reliefs, this large and beautiful Bodhisattva head. Like the small heads from Shrine xi, it has lost all trace of the original colouring in the fire that hardened it, but this has in no way impaired the fine modelling of the features and the cascading locks of hair. Seen next to the much smaller standing figures of devatas and similar pieces from the other shrines, the very scale of this head gives an idea of the size and richness of the whole ensemble, which must have included life-size or larger Buddha and Bodhisattva figures, as well as closely packed smaller figures.
In style and expression the head is close to the classical sculpture of Gandhara; in particular the half-closed eyes, like those of the Foucher Bodhisattva in the Musee Guimet, suggest meditation, and all of the other features are calm and regular.; Chinese

From Whitfield 1985:
This pair of devatas are among the most complete of the hundreds of figures found by Stein in the cella of a ruined temple at Ming-oi, not far from the one containing the wall paintings of the preceding plate. Stein dated them and most of the other stuccos from the site to the eighth century, on the basis of coins placed near the images, which were dated to the Dali (A.D. 766-79) and Jianzhong (A.D. 780-83) reigns (Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1194). In the museum’s own display, they were dated even later, as eighth-to tenth-century pieces. Had it not been for the presence of these coins, Stein would have dated the images considerably earlier, but he felt that the numismatic evidence was conclusive and that the earlier style of the figures could be sufficiently accounted for by the discovery of moulds, which could have continued in use for centuries.
    As we have just seen in Pl. 95, there is no doubt that the Ming-oi site, with its extensive group of temples, was still in use in the Uighur period, since the costumes of the donors from the wall paintings are unmistakable. But the use of wall paintings as the principal decoration in this temple suggests that there had been a shift away from moulded stucco decorations, as the two media are not easily combined. Besides, coins could have been deposited by worshippers for as long as the temple remained accessible, and while the roofs of the shrines remained intact. Even after the collapse of the roofs, many unfired figures survived with their colouring until the present time. These considerations may allow us to establish the date of the figures according to their style, which is still close to the art of Gandhara. A later style. Showing Chinese influence, can also be identified in the stucco figures of some of the shrines, such as the Bodhisattva head of Pl. 102.
    In composition too, to judge by the sheer numbers of figures and the way that they were closely packed together (some groups still in situ are illustrated in photographs taken by Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. Ⅲ-Ⅴ), the relief decoration of the Ming-oi temples must have been comparable to that of Gandhara. Plate 96 shows some of these features in a single devata. Moulding was used extensively to give such figures their perfection of expression, with smooth and regular features, and for the appliqué scarves and ornaments. The devata is broken off at the knees, but Fig. 140 allows us to see the proportions of the long and slender legs of a similar piece. All are built up of layers of clay applied to a core of reeds bound in a bundle, over which the moulded form fitted as a final layer. Fire has destroyed the reed core, leaving only the impression of this and its binding, and has totally removed the original colouring, but at the same time it has hardened the clay and ensured its survival. The scarf around the shoulders frames the figure and masks the join to the wall, as with the next figure. Changes in attitude were probably made by adjusting the still-moist impression as taken from the mould, as was certainly done with many of the small heads shown in Pls. 104-9.
    Some actual moulds for small parts of figures are in the Stein Collection. One, Mi. iv. 001 (Fig. 148), is for casting a small single seated figure of the Buddha, two curls of hair, and two zig-zag locks (Serindia, Vol. Ⅳ, Pl. CXXXVII). Far more spectacular are the moulds made for the whole upper body and head of comparatively large figures, which are among the finds made by Oldenburg at Kucha and are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. More than thirty moulds were found at Ming-oi by Grunwedel and Le Coq (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 192). These moulds, like the one just referred to in the Stein Collection, are of plaster of Paris.; Chinese

斯坦因於明屋遺址發現上圖壁畫的寺的附近的一個寺址中的室裏發現數百塑像，這兩身天部像是其中破損最輕的兩件。斯坦因把同一遺迹的大致相同的這些泥像都斷爲8世紀。那是因爲離像不遠的地方發現了大曆（766～779年）和建中（780～783年）的貨幣（參照《西域》卷3，1194頁）。而在大英博物館的展品說明中，把它們的年代往後推至8～10世紀。如果沒有貨幣，斯坦因大概還會認爲這些像的年代更早，貨幣成了決定性的作用。有關這些像延襲了早期表現風格這點，數百年延續使用下來的模型的發現，可作充分說明。
正如圖95所示，明屋遺址以及許多寺院群無疑在回鶻時期仍然使用，根據壁畫上供養人的衣裳就能一目了然。但壁畫作爲該佛寺的主要裝飾而存在，顯示了由泥塑造像向壁畫图樣的轉變。因爲把兩者融洽地組合，是件不容易的事情。另外，貨幣遺物可能是塑造泥像沒遭破壞寺院仍然運轉時信徒們捐獻的香資。特別是屋脊沒有損壞而完整保留下來的寺中，即使倒塌了但沒有失火，塑像直到現在還完全保留著色彩。綜合以上考慮，這些像的年代，以風格極接近犍陀羅美術作爲最主要根據來判斷更合適。時代越往後，越能見到中國的影響，如圖102的菩薩頭部等及若干寺院的泥像。
結構上，其實由衆多像構成以及它們的組成方式（奧登堡在遺迹現場拍攝的若干圖的照片已收錄於他1914年的報告裏）等方面，這些明屋遺迹的身雕裝飾可與犍陀羅身雕裝飾進行比較。圖96中展示了具備那幾處特點的天部像。連細部都廣泛使用模子，産生出光滑有規則的表現。再者，天衣和裝飾物等粘貼的裝飾也用模子。此像膝蓋以下已缺損，但從Fig. 140我們可以推測出此像的比例。
這些像是在捆緊的槁草芯上反復塗上塑土，其上再安裝用模子製作的外形造型。經過火災，槁草的芯燃盡，只剩形狀和捆綁的繩子痕迹，色彩也比當初有變化，但經過燃燒塑土變得很堅硬，耐保存。披在兩肩上的天衣，像畫框一樣圍著塑像，遮蓋了鄰像和牆壁間的接合部。姿勢和表情的變化，可能是從模子裏取出以後，在半乾狀態下調整的，從圖104～109中展示的若干小像頭部可以窺出其究竟。
斯坦因的收集品中，包括很多實際製作這些像細部使用的模子，有一個小佛坐像的模子（Mi.iv.001）、兩個卷髮的模子、兩個穗狀頭髮的模子（參照《西域》，卷4，圖版CXXXVII）等。另外，奧登堡在庫車收集到的遺物中，有製作大型像上半身和頭部使用的大模子，現陳列于艾爾米塔什美術館。格倫威德爾和勒柯克在明屋發現的模子也有30多個（參照“Grunwedel”， 1912，192頁）。在巴黎的石膏模子與現在所談的斯坦因收集品中的模子相同。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

這些像是在捆緊的槁草芯上反復塗上塑土，其上再安裝用模子製作的外形造型。經過火災，槁草的芯燃盡，只剩形狀和捆綁的繩子痕迹，色彩也比當初有變化，但經過燃燒塑土變得很堅硬，耐保存。披在兩肩上的天衣，像畫框一樣圍著塑像，遮蓋了鄰像和牆壁間的接合部。姿勢和表情的變化，可能是從模子裏取出以後，在半乾狀態下調整的，從圖104～109中展示的若干小像頭部可以窺出其究竟。
斯坦因的收集品中，包括很多實際製作這些像細部使用的模子，有一個小佛坐像的模子（Mi.iv.001）、兩個卷髮的模子、兩個穗狀頭髮的模子（參照《西域》，卷4，圖版CXXXVII）等。另外，奧登堡在庫車收集到的遺物中，有製作大型像上半身和頭部使用的大模子，現陳列于艾爾米塔什美術館。格倫威德爾和勒柯克在明屋發現的模子也有30多個（參照“Grunwedel”， 1912，192頁）。在巴黎的石膏模子與現在所談的斯坦因收集品中的模子相同。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts",On display (G33/dc9b/s3),,,deity; 神 (Chinese),,,,,,,,,1917,"The 1917-11-28 group (with MAS numbering) refers to objects from Stein's  Second Central Asian Expedition, 1906-08.

Vajrapāṇi's musculature is prominent and his open eyes are deep-set; a deep fold under the cheek marks age, as on ascetics. The still taller Buddha has three garments clearly indicated, the drapery folds in curved terraces in high relief, and his right hand, palm inwards, is held across the breast while his pendent left is covered in the robe. His head is oval, eyes narrow and slanting, and hair waved and abundant into the uṣṇīṣa. Kneeling before the Buddha, one knee down, the other raised, hands joined at the finger tips, is a figure in uttarīya and paridhāna, collar and earrings, with abundant hair under a large coiled chignon. Beside him is a damaged, similar but standing figure in a mannered posture with hands once joined. Five more or less half-length figures look on or throw flowers, some with chignons on the side of the head, one with a cross-hatched turban and floral crest. Paired grooves for drapery folds are common.
The trapezoidal compartment has moulded borders. Above, a modified dentil-and-drop or bead-and-reel moulding is surmounted by a register of clusters of knotted acanthus leaves with opening lotuses rising out of them and separated by half-rosettes enclosed in a border.
The middle compartment shows an enthroned Bodhisattva flanked by figures; the two on draped seats wear cross-hatched crested turbans, the usual ornaments and uttarīya and paridhāna. Beside them are smaller, similarly dressed figures, with collars and coiled chignons; all join their hands and their feet rest on footstools. Behind them stand more such figures, two framed in the canopy of the throne. The Bodhisattva raises his hand in abhaya at 45 degrees and forward from the body; he holds a water pot and wears only a collar, bracelets and earrings as ornaments, uttarīya and paridhāna, and his chignon is secured by a band. Though full, his long face is also angular with open, almost staring eyes. The throne has turned legs and drapery, broken pillars supporting a flat canopy with a series of small festoons and tufts projecting at the sides. The curved and projecting borders have two registers of sawtooth enrichment and, on each side, a volute formed by a beaked head and neck. A framed register of stellate petals spans the top.
In the top compartment, now incomplete, a now headless Buddha turns to his right towards two standing figures with uttarīya and no ornaments; one joins his hands, the nearer perhaps once extended a hand towards the Buddha. On his left are a kneeling figure, the raised knee towards the Buddha, and another, half-length in an uttarīya, both damaged.
In the tympanum is a sea-monster (panther) with a curled tail, once presumably worshipping a figure or cult object at the top with one or more corresponding figures beyond it (compare BM 1902.1002.23).

Representations of palace life can agree with the composition of the Renunciation scenes as here and may imply an intentional contrast as well as closeness in time: thus the Bodhisattva lies on a bed with his wife seated on it while female musicians sit and lie around them; or the Bodhisattva and his wife are seated on the couch side by side.

Jar with two seated Buddha figures

This jar carries a very early Chinese representation of the Buddha on either side of the jar. Buddhism was introduced to China from India and by the first century AD was rapidly gaining popularity among the Chinese people who readily adapted the teachings of Buddha to sit alongside their own indigenous religions and philosophies. Stonewares made in this region of northern Zhejiang province are characterised by a dark clay body and thin yellowish-green glaze.  Potters achieved this glaze colour by using a mixture of wood ash and clay. They then fired these wares in ‘dragon kilns’ which were built following the natural undulating curves of the hillsides.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese

這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese

正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。

畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。

注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1983:
This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳(Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.
In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.
Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.
A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.
The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.
Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。

I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3 m by 2 m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction. 
We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).
The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.
This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.
The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.
Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.
In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.
Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).
Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.
Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1983:
正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。
1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。
與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。
觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。 
畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。
從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。
這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。
接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。
以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。
新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。
D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。
以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。
在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。
如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。
注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。
綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。",Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Stein 1921b / The Thousand Buddhas.

The execution has many distinctive features: the pronounced and expressively angular form of the bodies; their contorted postures; their compression in sometimes flattened planes within the panel; the slight inclination of the columnar stone in the centre and the Buddha's sloping posture, both of which suggest that the Buddha is arresting its fall. The narrow, sometimes slanting eyes and the hairstyle are reminiscent of features that seem to be in a late style and the similarity of this panel with BM 1913.1108.21 is suggestive, given the same donor, of an identity of workshop and site.
Devadatta's murder attempts are summarised below. At the first attempt Devadatta sent men at intervals and in increasing numbers, whom the Buddha successively converted. At the second attempt Devadatta hurled down a great stone, but a yakṣa intercepted it and only a fragment injured the Buddha. Then Devadatta persuaded mahouts to loose Nālāgiri, a fierce elephant, but the Buddha's compassion halted its assault and the elephant paid him reverence.
In the Mūlasarvāstivādin Vinaya, Devadatta's first attempt was to have an engineer set up a contrivance worked by five hundred men to kill the Buddha and arranged for yet others to kill him if it failed; the mechanics repented and, before setting off the contrivance, descended to the Buddha by magic steps and were converted. Trying again with fresh assistants, Devadatta shot a stone from the catapult; Vajrapāṇi shattered it and the yakṣa Kumbhīra lost his life trying to stop a fragment injuring the Buddha's foot.
Foucher's original assumption of a wall separating the Buddha and his would-be assassins, generally adopted although textually unsupported, was first challenged by Hargreaves, 1924-5: 150-3, who proposed to recognise the second attempt only and a stone instead of Foucher's wall. Subsequently Foucher, 1905-51: II, 848 ad 541, proposed to see in representations with his wall, which he now too considered a rock, a combination of the first and second attempts of the general tradition and, in Calcutta G. 10/A23281 and perhaps this example, the Buddha trying to steady a stone; Taddei, 1963a: 40-1, quoting both Hargreaves and Foucher's recantation of 1951, would rather see a 'heavy square stone or pillar' whose fall the Buddha stops than a real wall which in Gandhāra is always shown frontally. Moreover both Hargreaves and Taddei illustrate carvings where the same type of columnar stone or pillar is being manoeuvred into position, not only by itself but also, and evidently in continuous narration, with the more usual representation of the murder attempt with the Buddha beside an upright stone or pillar. While those panels where a stone is being manoeuvred seem close to the catapult story, the representation of the Buddha with the stone and the murderers is less so, for they abandoned their contrivance and descended the mountain by a stair before their conversion; a variant or continuous narration must be assumed.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and worn.

All  the finds were shipped to London for sorting, research and publication, and  subsequent distribution. The distribution of the finds between London and  India was determined by specialists, appointed by the Government of India  (through the India Office, London) and the British Museum, who drew up  lists of the objects for approval by both sides.

The panel is one of a small group showing a humped bull at the Buddha's feet and, where clear, licking them; a figure apparently its herd or owner and, in two cases at least, a figure offering a purse. This group has been referred by Santoro in two articles first to the Chinese version of a lost Indian original and subsequently to the Divyāvadāna. In the Chinese a bull being led to slaughter ran towards the Buddha, fell weeping at his feet and begged to be saved; the Buddha explained that formerly, as a cakravartin, on encountering a man taken up for debt he had offered double repayment to release him. The money was never paid until, in his present rebirth as a bull, when his purchase price equalled the value of the debt, the Buddha, with the help of Indra, Brahmā and the four mahārājas, offered his owner treasure to fill two bull-hides; the bull came away with the Buddha and in a following human rebirth became destined for nirvana. The Divyāvadāna tells of a bull which, while being led out of Vaiśālī to the slaughter by a butcher, broke his bonds, ran towards the Buddha, knelt and licked his feet; despite the Buddha's urging, the butcher, pleading poverty, refused to spare him until the Buddha, with the help of Indra, provided three times the bull's value.
Santoro (1990), proposing, where Indra does not hold the purse, to see the lokapāla Kubera-Vaiśravaṇa, perhaps justified by the Chinese, does not commit herself to either story and discusses problems raised by ambivalent figural evidence.
For the ambiguous history of this piece see BM 1912.1221.1.; Zwalf 1985
This panel shows a humped bull licking the Buddha's feet, the Buddha's guardian spirit Vajrapāṇi, with thunderbolt, and a turbaned worshipper; a figure crowned like the god Indra offers a bag, perhaps ransom for the bull, to a man with an implement who may be its owner or a herdsman. A panel in Peshawar Museum also shows a humped bull licking the Buddha's feet and attendant figures but no transaction as suggested above. These scenes may be versions of an episode found in a text which makes a characteristic Buddhist point. A monk, who had once abused his hearers for their stupidity by calling them buffaloes, was reborn a buffalo with an ungovernable temper. On seeing the Buddha, however, he fell at his feet and licked them, so gaining a happier lot in his next existence.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

A certain nāga's prospect of salvation depended on a Buddha coming into the world and he therefore devised a set of questions which only a Buddha could answer. When this happened he paid homage to the Buddha first 'in his own natural body' and then as 'a Manava youth'.
For this story in continuous narration on the Prasenajit Pillar at Bhārhut see Bachhofer, 1929: I, pl. 23 (letterpress with the Chinese story) and Luders, 1963: pl. XXXIX, where the nāga or serpent appears three times, twice in human form with a five-headed serpent rising over his head and once as a five-headed serpent. Representations in Gandhāra fall into a number of types. One shows the nāga kneeling before the Buddha in human form while behind him, in a fenced tank, a figure with joined hands may have a serpent rising behind it. Perhaps this is a case of continuous narration with the same nāga in serpent and human form or, as Foucher believes, the nāga as human and his daughter still in serpent form and in the tank.
Another type shows the serpent in animal form before the Buddha's seat and in human form to the Buddha's far right (Peshawar I7I6) beyond seated monks. The lost left side of the present piece prevents it from being grouped with Peshawar 1716 where continuous narration presumably explains the two forms of the nāga. A third version (Bombay 22), without monks, shows a nāga in human form directly to the Buddha's right, as serpent before his throne, while an ascetic with a damaged water pot stands on his left; this distribution may recur on the damaged Bombay 21 (AIIS 131-68) where a serpent appears below the Buddha's seat and an ascetic with a water pot stands on his left, but none of the other figures now shows the attached serpent.

The cutting of all the figures and details is stiff and sometimes sharp, with grooves and ridges to define drapery folds; the heads are round and full, the eyes rounded and protruding. This is one of a small group of pieces showing a varying number of monks, all with their right shoulders bare, of whom one sometimes carries a spouted pot and one regularly presents a circular seat. For examples see Swat V.422, an incomplete scene with three monks, one with hands joined, another carrying the seat draped as far as a distinct arcaded motif below; Chatpat 44, on which five monks approach the Buddha, one with the draped seat showing only convex mouldings at the bottom. The same presentation recurs in the iconography of BM 1914.0502.1. Examples are San Francisco (B6o SI); a piece in private hands where monks approach a disc with petalled rays and hold a seat barely showing at the bottom an undulating motif below the low drapery; yet another example of such an offering places the Buddha beside three wheels on a column and touching or turning a large wheel behind it (Kurita, 1988-90: I, fig. 272). On this piece an arcaded motif seems visible on the seat but a similar piece, Columbia 80.202 (Nagar, 1981: 10-11), although heavily abraded, seems to show the type of the almost totally draped seat. Dani tentatively suggests that Chatpat 44 shows the offering of a seat before the First Sermon, although a rectangular seat is offered in the few cases where a connection with the First Sermon in the usual iconography is certain or probable. The rectangular seat recurs on fragments where the connection can only be presumed but may also be found with a variant of BM 1970.0602.1. It is striking that round seats associated with iconographies discussed in BM 1914.0502.1 and BM 1970.0602.1 can be almost wholly draped as well as showing a construction suggesting that of the cane seat of Bodhisattvas and other persons.
The attribution of this piece to the cycle of the First Sermon can be only tentative, given that it stands on its own, that the numbers and attributes of the monks in the different examples vary and that the iconography of the scenes associated with BM 1914.0502.1 and BM 1970.0602.1 may still be thought uncertain. A further context for the presentation of a seat has yet to be established.
The presentation of a seat occurs when, after determining where and to whom to preach the First Sermon, the Buddha went on a begging round at Benares and then directed his steps to the Deer Garden at Sarnath where the five bhadravargīya ascetics, once his companions in mortification of the flesh, saw him coming. Since he had abandoned their joint quest for salvation, they first wished to deny him all honour and welcome, but as he approached their resistance left them and one took his bowl and over-robe, another offered him a seat, yet another a footstool and another water for his feet.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and with soil incrustation.

The ridged feature in her group of three Santoro explains as the river into which Āṭavika had threatened to throw the Buddha if he had failed to answer his questions.

The story of this scene survives in the Chinese canon and was first published in this context by Foucher in a translation by Chavannes. A king of Candravatī, his mind poisoned by the jealousy of his other wives, caused his pregnant youngest wife to be killed and buried. A posthumous son, however, nourished himself from one breast on a half of his mother's corpse not decomposed; when he was three the collapse of part of the tomb released him, and when he was six he met the Buddha and became an arhat. Subsequently he saw and converted his own father and the Buddha revealed their relationship, explaining the recent events from an earlier series in the time of a previous Buddha. The child's name, Sudāya, is restored from the Chinese both in this narrative and in another version, where a pregnant mother dies, is buried in a tomb, gives birth and the child feeds on her milk for seven years before meeting the Buddha and becoming an arhat.
The naked child standing and kneeling is Sudāya, who thus appears in this example, as in others, in continuous narration crouching beside the corpse of his mother and standing before the Buddha; he can also appear only once, beside his mother or standing.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist with crystalline inclusions, broken and exfoliated.

On the far left a small figure with long hair and on top a short horizontal length, looped and secured across the middle with one end pointing up, wearing a girdled paridhāna and uttarīya, turns towards the central figure and holds an opening lotus by its stalk in his right hand. He appears to be a young brāhmaṇa ascetic. In front of him a long-haired old brāhmaṇa ascetic, bearded, with a similar loop of hair on top and an uttarīya, joins his hands in the direction of the Buddha. Behind the monk in front is another brāhmaṇa ascetic with long hair, carved almost on the scale of the Buddha; and beyond the Buddha, again behind a monk, the very large head and torso of a young brāhmaṇa ascetic with long hair and the same style of hair on top as the other brāhmaṇas. Beside the Buddha are three monks in all, two with hands joined and right shoulder bare and one holding a lotus bud by its stalk in one hand, the robe in another and having both shoulders covered. Two appear to have one of the three monastic garments folded over the left shoulder, as in Eastern Indian, Sri Lankan and South-east Asian representations, and marked with rectangles representing the patches of cloth from which monastic garments were prescriptively made, features exceedingly rare in Gandhāra sculpture. In the centre the haloed and dominating Buddha stands almost in three-quarter view with moustache and densely linear hair with the uṣṇīṣa a large bun-chignon bound with a plain band. He raises the open right hand at right angles to the chest and secures the robe with the left hand. Both shoulders are covered and the drapery folds, as on the robes of the three monks, are defined by dense grooves, sometimes overlapping or crossing in a disorganised manner. Beyond the monks and at the far right, corresponding to the lotus-holding ascetic in the opposite corner, stands a woman with tunic, a paridhāna with girdle round it and a scarf running in the narrow mode from the left shoulder. Her hair forms a tall loop, and she wears earrings, anklets and a collar and holds a large opening lotus by its stalk in her left hand. What appears to be a prostrate figure before the Buddha can scarcely be made out except as a broken curved outline of the back, a slightly more defined head and one distinguishable elbow.
Apart from the fact that the Buddha's face has open eyes with a narrow ring of lids and incised pupils, the heads of the other figures are very similar, long to oval, with mechanical modelling, even where the monks' leanness is conveyed in sharp noses and chins and chisel marks, and the eyes are large, rounded and protruding, only rarely showing lids. The effect, perhaps partly due to wear, is of a staring remoteness, also seen in the Buddha.
The young ascetic on the left is, like the prostrate figure below the Buddha, perhaps Megha. They would thus form a scene in continuous narration and, while the position and appearance of the young woman on the far right readily suggest a donor, she may be Prakṛti and the whole composition could then be an early representation of the Dīpaṃkara story, despite the appearance of ascetics, unexplained in this context, unless they are connected with the presence of a fellow student of the Bodhisattva.

By tradition the future Gautama Buddha, as a young Brahmin in a previous birth, took his Bodhisattva vow to become a Buddha before an earlier Buddha called Dīpaṃkara.

Three haloed broad-chested Buddhas sit frontally on rectangular seats, two in dhyāna and one in abhaya. The over-robes of all three form the common semi-circular edge on the seat and have the fall of gathered drapery on the left spreading to lie flat; while the edge of the over-robe runs in the usual way over the right forearm in the abhaya gesture, the over-robe of the two figures in dhyāna completely covers the right thigh and knee of the Buddha on the right and only partly the thigh of the Buddha on the left. The drapery folds are everywhere defined by paired grooves. The abhaya hand is lost, those in dhyāna seem very large. The faces are oval and full, the wavy hair drawn back into the uṣṇīṣa. The seats are strewn with grass, and have plinths and patterned faces.
From right to left, the first Buddha is attended by a damaged monk and separated from the next Buddha by a youthful Vajrapāṇi standing with legs crossed at the ankles towards the second Buddha but turning from the waist upwards towards the first, one hand on hip, the other holding what was a long vajra from hip to shoulder. His straight hair curls on the shoulders, his chest is modelled and his loincloth bulges over the genitals. Beside the second Buddha a monk stands with his head turned towards the Bodhisattva, his robe in paired grooves for folds, his right shoulder bare, his damaged right hand appearing to hold a flower (lotus or lotuses) above the shoulder while his left holds what may be a long thick stalk curving over the shoulder, though the condition of the stone above it reveals little. The haloed and turbaned Bodhisa-ttva, seated with legs crossed below the knees on a cylindrical cane stool and wearing an uttarīya and paridhāna with pointed ends, is badly damaged; his left lower arm, which seems awkwardly reattached, may have been in the pensive gesture and connected with a small projection on the halo above. The next Vajrapāṇi, in close fitting knee-length tunic with some swallow-tail folds, stands almost frontally, the vajra vertical against his left shoulder and his right hand holding the bottom of a stalk; a damaged projection above the shoulder may be the lost flower(s). The folds of the tunic curve concentrically with the neck and a flap hangs from the left shoulder.

The Buddha, taller than the flanking figures, stands in the centre of the panel in a posture of marked flexion, the abhaya hand bent back and the pendent left hand securing the robe. The drapery folds are marked by broad shallow grooves, some containing pairs of narrower grooves, and the raised neckline comes almost to a point; both shoulders are covered and two undergarments are visible. The wavy hair continues into the large uṣṇīṣa. At the Buddha's feet a kneeling serpent deity with hands joined wears a turban with a high crest and an uttarīya in the wide mode; his prominent five-headed serpent rather far above him is joined to the side of his turban by a neck in very low relief. Beside him and facing the Buddha a larger pair of serpent deities stands side by side in a crescentic curve, their visible arms curved above their heads. The male, with five-headed serpent just above, wears a turban with a high crest, a long earring, a collar and necklace, a paridhāna with rounded ends over his left leg and an uttarīya in the narrow mode; the female has a wreath, perhaps of cloth with a beaded motif and a flower as headdress, on wavy hair, an earring, collar and necklace, anklets, a diaphanous sleeved blouse leaving a bare midriff, a paridhāna and a scarf looping from the arms across the lower body. In her raised arm she may hold flowers, as perhaps in her joined hands does the smaller female figure, who is similarly dressed.
Above and behind the serpent deities arc the conventional rounded projections of mountainous terrain. In the top corner a half-length male figure holds a spear, opposite him beside the Buddha a small bare-backed Vajrapāṇi appears striding with outstretched and raised arms, holding a vajra, while the bust of another, small figure emerges below and is turned towards the Buddha.
Beside the Buddha stands another, taller Vajrapāṇi, also seen from the back, with his long overgarment looped across the legs, perhaps adapting the Western mode seen in BM 1922.0211.1, 1892.0801.10 and 1880.37, a small chignon on top of his head and the vajra emerging behind his left shoulder; he looks away from the Buddha at a monk whose right arm across the chest is wrapped in the robe. A figure with a crested turban, a paridhāna with pointed ends and a scarf billowing up from his left arm stands beside the monk with hands joined. Four half-length figures above, some turbaned and all wearing an uttarīya, raise their hands with flowers or join them in homage.

In the complete scene the Buddha is seated centrally, on a damaged draped seat with turned legs, in abhaya and securing the over-robe in the left hand while gathered drapery spreads below it. Leafy branches spread outward beside his unhaloed head. To his right a figure in uttarīya and with a small top-knot or chignon on a shaven head holds, in his left hand, a skull with a large eye cavity visible, while his right hand, with a bracelet, palm inwards and fingers curled towards the thumb, is held in front. Two figures converse beside him, one with curly hair and a chignon, the other turbaned; both wear an uttarīya, a collar and earrings. The latter raises one hand and may hold flowers in the other. To the Buddha's left a monk, with one shoulder bare and shaven head with a hairline, holds in the left hand a damaged object, no doubt, on the evidence of parallels, once a skull; he raises his right hand with the index and middle fingers joined. Another monk appears half-length between him and another figure with curled hair, a chignon, an uttarīya, a paridhāna, earrings, bracelets and hands joined.
The incomplete scene, which presumably was continued on the adjacent piece, contains a turbaned figure, hands joined, the uttarīya and paridhāna in some relief, a head with wavy hair and a monk, also turned, presumably towards a Buddha, both shoulders covered, his lowered right hand in the robe, his left hand holding it at shoulder level. The drapery folds are everywhere shown by thin grooves.
The framing elements each contain a naked amorino on a pot with everted rim; one joins his hands, the other has one hand on his hip and the other raised to a leafy branch.

This piece belongs to a group first recognised by Taddei (J979: 395-420) in which a central Buddha is flanked on his right by a brāhmaṇa with topknot emerging from his wrapped head and, opposite, by a monk, each holding a skull; in his examples the brāhmaṇa consistently holds his right hand as here but the Buddha's gesture varies and in one case the facing monk is replaced by a lay figure without a skull. A shaven head with a topknot occurs only on the above.
The underlying story was quoted by Taddei from the Pāli. It tells of a  brāhmaṇa who, by tapping the skulls of the dead, could determine in which destination they had been reborn. In the Buddha's presence he correctly identified four rebirths, but could say nothing about the skull of an arhat and he therefore joined the Order to learn the secret. In a comparable account in Sanskrit the skull-tapper is the son of a ṛṣi and an antelope and, having a head like an antelope's, is called Mṛgaśiras; Ānanda puts him to the test with four skulls and, when he fails over the last, an arhat's skull, brings him before the Buddha who explains that the liberated have no destination; he becomes a monk and attains nirvāṇa when the Buddha demonstrates the uncertainty of life as demonstrated by the monk's inaccurate predictions of rain.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and chipped.

After the passage of the two merchants the Buddha, thinking the Doctrine too profound, hesitated to propagate it, but in his compassion resolved to do so if asked by the crested Mahābrahmā or Śikhī and inspired him accordingly. Śikhī  invited Indra to join him in supplication and they, with the four mahārājas or lokapālas and other gods of various heavens, went to the Buddha who, after hesitations and repeated requests, finally consented. Mahāvastu III.314-20 tells substantially the same story without naming the Mahābrahmā further while the parallel story ibid.: I.230 makes a Mahābrahmā the only supplicant in Dīpaṃkara's case; Brahmā is the principal supplicant in Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra (Lamotte, 1944-80: I, 57-60) and is alone in Saṃghabhedavastu I.129. In the Pāli tradition the Mahābrahmā Sahampati is the only supplicant. In the Jātaka Introduction (Fausboll, 1877-97: I, 81, translated Rhys Davids, 1925: 206-7) he is accompanied by many gods but he is alone in canonical accounts (Malalasekara, i960: II, 1080 s.v. Sahampati with references).
Scenes with this subject commonly show a simple composition with a central Buddha seated under a tree, Brahmā standing on the Buddha's right, Indra on his left, hands joined; sometimes the deities are haloed as on BM 1899.0715.10 and sometimes they kneel as on BM 1940.0713.3.

The haloed Buddha stands frontally in slight flexion, his right knee forward, the broken right hand originally in abhaya, the left pendent and covered in the over-robe. The neckline is tight and the drapery folds are mainly ridged. His head is oval and full. To the Buddha's left and turned towards him stands Indra, a haloed figure with crested turban, collar, uttarīya, paridhāna, hands joined and right knee flexed.

The faces are fleshy and full with narrow eyes.
The second scene down shows an encounter with a drummer. The haloed Buddha stands flexed in almost three-quarter view to the entire height of the scene, his damaged right hand in abhaya, his left hand securing the robe at his side, both shoulders covered and the robe edge in relief from the raised wrist to the left hand. Two undergarments are visible. The raised neckline is tight and the backthrow distinct. The Buddha's head is long and oval, and the inner features are asymmetrical; the uṣṇīṣa is bound at its base. The damaged drummer appears to wear a loincloth with the trace of a strap from his left shoulder for the banded barrel drum, which hangs obliquely so that his right hand strikes the top and his left hand the bottom. The figure stands in a flexed posture and has muscular legs contracted under the knees. Above him a figure raises an arm to throw flowers. Beside the Buddha a monk wearing a similar tight-necked robe secures it in his left hand and above him is another figure with one arm raised and a bowl-crop hairstyle.
The bottom scene of the upright shows the story of the dog.Unlike the other figures, the Buddha stands the full height of the scene but lowers his haloed head to address the animal. His over-robe covers both shoulders with a high neckline; his abhaya hand appears directed at the dog, while his left hand secures the robe a little above waist level and the edges in between stand out in some relief. The quite dense drapery folds are in a series of terraces. The Buddha's head is oval and the face full-fleshed with narrow eyes, the hair runs in almost straight lines into the uṣṇīṣa which has a fillet round its base. Squatting in front and looking up at him is a hairy and tailed animal, the undercut and nearer foreleg straight, the farther flexed. Behind it stands a monk with his right shoulder bare, the tonsured head thrown back, the features sharp. A half-length figure above with curly hair and round head bends forward, raising an arm to throw flowers. Beside the Buddha Vajrapāṇi, softly modelled, with clear features and with muscular legs narrowed at the knees, wears a lion's skin over the top and back of his head and secured across his chest by the forelegs, and a loincloth, perhaps the knotted hind legs of the skin. The flat vajra is held to his left shoulder by its narrowed middle and bottom. Another celestial above Vajrapāṇi has sharp features, narrow slanting eyes and a severe bowl-crop hairstyle. The expressive angle of the Buddha's body and the halo, almost detached from the back, enhance the sinuous character of the carving. The scene is flanked on one side by a half-pilaster with a summary Corinthian capital and the usual base mouldings under a sawtooth cornice. Along the right edge is a scrolled stalk with full-blown five-petalled rosettes.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 7.10 centimetres; Height: 17.20 centimetres bottom scene ; Height: 16.80 centimetres second scene down ; Height: 14.30 centimetres top scene ; Height: 55.20 centimetres; Width: 16.60 centimetres bottom scene ; Width: 16.50 centimetres second scene down ; Width: 16.60 centimetres top scene ; Width: 21.10 centimetres,,"The top scene could be a depiction of the Descent from the Trāyastriṃśa heaven (see BM 1917.1009.12) in an abbreviated representation. For another instance of a standing Buddha with Indra and Brahmā but without a stair interpreted as the Descent see Hargreaves in Marshall, 1951: II, 715, no. 110(a), and in, pl. 219, no. 110, where Indra's standing on the Buddha's right is acknowledged as being at variance with his usual position on the panels and the textual evidence that describes Indra's stair as on the Buddha's left.
Perhaps the second scene down of the upright shows the same subject as the left-hand scene on BM 1880.103.
The Buddha, entering the house of Śuka Mānava, son of Taudeya, saw his dog, Śaṅkhakuñjara, on a couch eating. When he saw the Buddha, Śaṅkhakuñjara barked, provoking from the Buddha a reproachful allusion to a previous encounter which so angered the dog that he sprang off the couch into an open drain below it. Thus Śuka found him on returning home and, angered by what he was told of the Buddha's words, sought him out and asked about the dog's previous existence. The Buddha explained that Śuka's father had been reborn as that dog and, to prove it, bade Śuka order the dog onto the couch to eat and, when he had obeyed, to show Śuka the treasure he had not revealed at the time of his death. Śaṅkhakuñjara leapt off the couch and, in another old room or building, he scratched and sniffed between the four legs of a couch, thus revealing four iron pots of gold. Śuka now returned to the Buddha in a favourable state of mind and the Buddha explained to his hearers that Śuka's rebirth, if he now died, would be as happy as it would have been grievous if he had died discontented towards him on account of his reproach to the dog. The iconography of this theme seems to fall into three groups: (a) as here where the animal is on the ground; (b) where the dog sits or stands on a seat or couch as in Peshawar 794 (Ingholt, 1957: fig. 120), 35L (Kurita, 1988-90: I, fig. 364), Lahore 1139 (ibid.: I, fig. 365); and (c) where two dogs, one on and another beneath a couch, must indicate continuous narration, as in the following piece where there is further discussion.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, slightly broken, worn and with some soil incrustation.

In the next scene a muscular and turbaned figure, wearing a paridhāna and an uttarīya perhaps tied round and hanging down from the waist, a bracelet, an earring and a collar, raises one hand to strike the barrel drum hanging from his left shoulder and further held below by his left hand as he turns to the Buddha. The taller Buddha stands almost frontally but with his damaged head towards the drummer, his left hand, now lost, was perhaps covered in the prominently and regularly ridged over-robe and his lost right hand originally no doubt performed the abhaya gesture.

In the first scene, which may have shown one or more ascetics facing the Buddha, the striding figure is not easily explained. The second scene could be classed with Foucher's
group with drummer representing, with or without a gateway as he later thought, the Entry into Rājagṛha. In the legend episodes with the Kāśyapa ascetics and the visit to Rājagṛha occur close together soon after the Enlightenment. Foucher defines his Entry into Rājagṛha from the Pāli canon as the Buddha and his monks coming for a meal at the invitation of king Bimbisāra when Indra, as a young brāhmaṇa, much admired for his looks, led the way singing verses. A meeting with King Bimbisāra and another with Uruvilva Kāśyapa and the king's invitation to a meal are generally reported at this stage in versions of the legend but while there can also be mention of a messenger (Saṃghabhedavastu) there is none of a musical escort except in the Pāli.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, chipped and with soil incrustation.

Beneath, a kneeling elephant, with a cloth on its back, holds in its trunk a parasol by the shaft. The mountainside has rounded contours, a damaged lion whose forepaws emerge from a cave and a small tree growing at the top; linear whorls here suggest vegetation, as do the small radiate patches on BM 1880.69, 1917.0501.2 and elsewhere.
On the Buddha's left the three figures are Indra in uttarīya and paridhāna, collar and a turban with a low cylindrical cap, joining his hands, and two others, both with crested turban and half-length, one with hands joined. Balancing them opposite, the harpist Pañcaśikha wears a short paridhāna with a knotted uttarīya round his waist, a high globular chignon with a band at its base above his short curled hair and a necklace; he rests his harp in the crook of his arm and raises his right hand to shoulder level, while two half-length figures behind and above him, one with curled hair and another with a crested turban, are presumably celestials watching. Pañcaśikha is in pronounced relief, his lower legs undercut.

The harpist Pañcaśikha is the second turbaned figure from the left in the bottom register, one leg awkwardly flexed, holding a harp in his left hand and a plectrum in his right. At both ends of the register an elephant protome, where undamaged, wears ornamental bands and holds flowers in its trunk; behind Indra is the curving stem of a flowering plant.
On the lowest register beside the cave, between plants, Vajrapāṇi sits on the left, probably bearded, with musculature indicated on the chest and arm, a damaged vajra against his right shoulder, a robe draped across the knees and with a worshipping and ornamented turbaned figure beside him. On the right of the cave a seated, ornamented and turbaned figure holding a spear, wearing a sleeved and girt knee-length tunic, one hand like Vajrapāṇi's on his knee and with a similar worshipping figure beside him, is also between plants. On the next register three figures balanced on each side turn towards the Buddha, four with hands joined, two holding garlands, two kneeling and all with turbans and uttarīya. Like the figures in the register above they stand or sit on rounded rocky projections which have small radiating patches of vegetation beneath, as on BM 1902.1002.18 where there is further discussion. On the top register from left to right are a damaged figure in meditation, a standing and couchant antelope, each on a ledge, a peacock with spread tail facing outwards, another peacock or parrot, and the indistinct outlines of rocky outcrops, damaged beasts or birds.

(Object),,,"Stupa drum panel showing the Birth of the Bodhisattva, the Bath and the Return to Kapilavastu in three scenes read from right to left under a register of standing figures. The first, incomplete scene shows part of the Birth with Māyā's arm raised to a branch, Indra leaning forward under a barrel drum and behind him a figure raising his hand to his mouth and the other over his head. In the next scene the haloed infant Bodhisattva stands under a parasol on an indistinct, perhaps lotus pedestal and is held, on each side, by a kneeling woman while Indra and Brahmā hold inverted narrow-necked pots over him. Beside Indra is a similar turbaned figure in uttarīya and paridhāna, hands perhaps joined. Brahmā, with short hair and lacking a chignon, appears half-length and in three-quarter view from the back and a similar figure beside him joins his hands.
In the third scene two turbaned figures in uttarīya and paridhāna carry a conveyance seen frontally and greatly resembling a chair with turned legs, a textile between them and high sides or posts voluted at the top. In it a woman wearing a wreath headdress sits with legs pendent holding a child. Two more bearers behind are visible only by their legs. Beside each is another figure; on the left he is entirely in profile and seems to be guiding his bearer who turns his head and right leg as though changing direction.
Noteworthy is the elongation of several figures in the panels.
The framed columns have Corinthian capitals and, above, between fillets, is a motif of heart shapes.
Along the whole length of the panel is an upper classicising register of figures in illusionistic poses difficult to distinguish in detail. Two women at least seem bare to the thighs with one hand on the hip and the other raised to the shoulder; several males, some appearing in motion, wear tunics under cloaks covering the shoulders and upper chest and one figure advances holding a large shield and with one hand raised to the shoulder. Several pairs are in postures of offering and receiving, but only on the second figure from the right is something like a cup or beaker suggested by what remains.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Kafir-Kot,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 5.90 centimetres; Height: 23.50 centimetres; Width: 49.80 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
Lamotte, 1944-80: III, 1343-4 (fn- 3) lists with references, also to the monuments, five forms of the literary tradition of the Bodhisattva's Bath before or after the Seven Steps: 1. A hot and cold stream of water falling from the sky; 2. The same but of terrestrial origin; 3. The same produced by the serpent kings Nanda and Upananda in the sky with Indra, Brahmā, the four lokapālas and other deities who bathe and sprinkle the Bodhisattva with variously perfumed waters and flowers; 4. The order inverted with Indra and Brahmā in the sky, bathing and sprinkling, followed by the serpent kings associated with the two streams and assisted by many other gods; 5. The serpent kings alone bathe the Bodhisattva with perfumed waters.
Representations of the Bodhisattva's Bath in Gandhāra usually agree in giving the child central position, under a parasol and often on a form of tripod stand and haloed, Brahmā (left) viewed from the back, and Indra (right) with inverted water pot to each side, while a flanking female may stand or kneel beside the child. Additional flanking deities of Brahmā and Indra type also occur. Panels of this subject showing wholly ophiomorphic nagas are very rarely reported. The attendant figure with palm branch, common at the Birth, appears to be on Swat WS 125, but seems unreported elsewhere with the present subject.

The haloed Buddha sits on a low seat in the centre of the panel, his over-robe on both shoulders; the neckline is in relief and somewhat plunging, the drapery folds in regularly curving and rounded ridges. He raises his right hand as if in abhaya with a seed or fruit (a mango) in the palm, and his left hand rests in his lap with gathered drapery undulating and spreading on the seat below. His long head is turned to his right, the eyes markedly narrow and slanting and the abundant hair drawn back from a peak over the forehead into a large uṣṇīṣa. His halo is large and plain and the leaves on the variously curving branches above him are long. His low seat appears to have a cushion and a flattened dentil-and-drop ornament above the plinth.
On the Buddha's left, Vajrapāṇi, with long, bearded face, modelled planes of musculature, genitals, a long draped overgarment from his left shoulder passing across the legs, holds a faceted vajra with rounded ends in his left hand and raises a fly-whisk like a torch in the right. Behind him are three ascetics; one with his back to the viewer, and with a short girt tunic over the left shoulder and hair gathered in a chignon on the top of his head, raises one arm and holds by the hand another, blind, bearded ascetic of emaciated appearance, wearing only a short lower garment and with hair loosely coiled into a wreath-like headdress.

Behind him, in a hut with a curled finial, another, possibly blind ascetic of similar dress and hairstyle sits on a stool with curved legs on which he supports himself with one hand while he holds a long curved pole in his right. His emaciation is emphasised by a sharp re-entrant angle below the ribcage. Balancing the half-length ascetic opposite is another figure, of youthful appearance, emerging from behind the hut.

Beside him Vajrapāṇi, a grieving old man with a broad chest, raises one arm over and across his head, which is turned away from the Buddha. He wears a short paridhāna and his uttarīya knotted as a thick scarf over his thighs, and his legs are undercut. His face is distinctly, almost finely, featured and two rows of curls over his lined forehead cover an otherwise bald head. The faceted vajra in his left hand lies against his shoulder. Above Vajrapāṇi is a tree with evenly paired leaves on the narrow curving branches and above the monk a mourner, both arms raised and ornamented, notably with armlets beside the shoulder, and wearing a small chignon and an uttarīya, looks on in grief.

He has a broad flat chest under a large damaged head with earrings and short curls dramatically thrown back; he brings his undercut arms, with armlets just beside the shoulders, together behind his head; his eyes are long, open and set above high cheek-bones. To his left two figures, ornamented and with uttarīya, one with a high crested turban, the other with arms folded and possibly a chignon over a short hairstyle with a curled border, appear to be in conversation; another figure, in particular relief, turbaned and ornamented and with a grief-stricken face, brings one hand to the side of his head. Behind them are damaged half-length figures. On the flowering tree with narrowing trunk the lower branches are undercut.
Below the tree two figures converse: a monk almost in profile, right shoulder bare and an undergarment visible above undercut legs, a small 'embonpoint' below a broken arm, faces another figure with his right hand lifted, an undergarment also visible but his over-robe, which leaves the right shoulder bare, covering the gently inclined head, the backthrow passing round the neck. In the figure with a draped head and usually a bundle of sticks and talking with a monk in scenes of the Death cycle Foucher supposed that an ascetic of the tridaṇḍa-carrying order had replaced, in announcing the Buddha's death to Mahākāśyapa, the naked ājīvika of the piece in the previous catalogue entry, but in certain scenes learning of the circumstances before meeting Mahākāśyapa.

This panel contrasts with BM 1899.0715.9 in detail and delicacy, rounded cutting, composition and proportions.
The damaged figure behind the Buddha is perhaps a deity; other instances of a mourner, of large and energetic appearance, are seen elsewhere and also behind the bed among the gesturing Mallas or deities. On Peshawar 2084 a central figure with similar gesture has whiskers and an unusual headdress (turban). On Lahore 1037 a prominent central figure is the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, but the corresponding figure on Peshawar 775 has a turban and an uttarīya. For the size of the head see the same feature on Swat Butkara 2892 (Faccenna-Taddei, 1962-4: II, pl. CDXIII) where, under the Bodhisattva's horse and between its hind legs, a yakṣa has a huge head, voluminous hair and moustache; and if this is an albeit occasional feature of a yakṣa, perhaps the figure here is another example.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Pemberton 2002 / The Buddha,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, chipped and with small losses.

The Bodhisattva, who is taller than the other figures and leans forward in three-quarter view, wears the monastic robe over both shoulders with two undergarments showing, his left hand apparently covered in the robe at shoulder level and his lowered right in abhaya beside the joined hands of Kālika. Kālika and his consort Suvarṇaprabhāsā are almost in profile, both with hands joined. Kālika wears a crested turban, an uttarīya and paridhāna, with one thick robe end swinging forward and a five-headed serpent rising above his head. Suvarṇaprabhāsā has a wreath headdress, a garment from her left shoulder, a paridhāna round it and a scarf, and above her head a broken, probably single-headed serpent indicates her nature. Behind Kālika's arms rise two lotuses on separate stalks and below him, incomplete, is the blown-petal ornament on the side of the nāgas' pool from which the flowers may be supposed to rise. Beside the Bodhisattva, Vajrapāṇi, in three-quarter view from the back and naked to the waist, holds the vajra in his left hand. Two damaged, probably male figures stand beside Vajrapāṇi, and above him, barely half-length, turbaned deities are observing. On both sides the lost shafts of the pilasters probably also once had worshipping amorini, as in the upper scene, and above the Corinthian capitals is a bracket capital with one voluted bracket arm only. Separating the scenes horizontally is a cavetto enriched with a pattern of acanthus leaves with a drooping lobe in the middle and flanking lobes with points meeting those of adjacent leaves.

On both sides are two figures of the guardians of the cardinal points (mahārāja or lokapāla) in varieties of three-quarter view, each wearing a chignon, uttarīya and paridhāna; on the Buddha's left each holds a large bowl, on his right the nearer figure clearly has the remains of one but the other, while showing no damage to the hands, only joins them. Beside the Buddha's shoulders and flanking the pendent branches are the heads of observing deities.

The encounter with the nāgarāja Kālika occurred on the way to the bodhi tree, when the splendour from the Bodhisattva's body illumined Kālika's palace and Kālika spoke verses foretelling the inevitability of the Enlightenment; Kālika's wife, Suvarṇaprabhāsā, along with serpent maidens, showered the Bodhisattva with flowers, jewels and so on, and also spoke verses of praise. In the Pāli tradition the nāgarāja Kāla hears the Bodhisattva throw a bowl into the Nerañjarā and, as it strikes the bowls of previous Buddhas, praises him and predicts the Enlightenment. The present subject and the Submission of Apalāla can be represented with a similar iconography (see 214, Lahore 1057) when the nāga couple appear in an enclosed pool or spring, but the Apalāla subject is usually distinguished by a second Vajrapāṇi in a posture of assault or menace against the nāgas and the Buddha may appropriately be accompanied by monks; for the Kālika subject fenced enclosures seem usual, while Apalāla can appear on rocks, in water and so on. For the two iconographies see Foucher, 1905-51: 1, 544ff, and further under BM 1947.1016.1. On an incomplete upright, Rome MNAOR 430/7 (Taddei, 1970: fig. 66), where the upper scene has the same subject as the present upright (see 189), the lower scene, which may show the Measuring of the Buddha, presents a generally similar compositional scheme as here, although a number of details differ.
After the seven weeks' meditation and fasting that followed the Enlightenment, a large caravan belonging to two merchants called Trapuṣa and Bhallika was suddenly stopped in its tracks when it approached the neighbourhood of the tree under which the Buddha was. When they had seen him, the two merchants offered food, the four mahārājas each brought a stone bowl and the Buddha caused the bowls to become one, leaving only lines below the rim to show that there had been more bowls. After the merchants had made the profession of faith in himself and the Doctrine and in the future Order, the Buddha gave them cuttings from his hair and nails as relics.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken and chipped.

(Object); The Invitation of the Śākyas. (Object); The Intervention of Ānanda. (Object),,,"The top scene perhaps shows the Invitation of the Śākyas. The haloed Buddha, shown on a larger scale than the other figures, is seated in abhaya, both shoulders covered, the neckline prominent and tight, the over-robe with folds defined by grooves, some paired, and the edge from the right forearm curving in relief down to the gathered drapery on the seat from under the left hand. The head and neck are long and the wavy hair continues into the large uṣṇīṣa. Beside the halo leafy branches hang downwards. The Buddha's high and strewn seat is otherwise plain. On his right is a kneeling monk, damaged hands formerly joined and right shoulder bare, between two watching half-length figures with garments apparently over both shoulders; on the Buddha's left a monk, seated with one leg at an angle suggesting a kneeling rather than a crossed-leg position, wears the robe oyer both shoulders, with the hands in dhyāna and covered. Between him and the Buddha, to judge from the tonsure, is another monk. The heads are long and oval, the features sometimes sharp and the eyes rounded and protruding.
Second scene down of four on an upright, with the Dīpaṃkara jātaka in two incidents. The Buddha Dīpaṃkara stands with an outstretched hand in abhaya to the full height of the scene, his left hand securing the robe at waist level. Both shoulders are covered, the neckline is high and in low relief and the usual undergarments are visible. The hair is in wavy strands and with a seemingly coiled uṣṇīṣa. Megha appears twice. As a standing figure, holding flowers in his hands, he has long hair and a chignon, drapery wound round his left shoulder and upper arm, and a lower garment with a girdle; his chest and arms are muscular. He is then shown almost on all fours before Dīpaṃkara with his right forearm lying on the framing fillet below. Behind Megha stands a woman with a garment over her left shoulder and a girt paridhāna round it, a collar and anklets, a high chignon, and holding a flower in her raised right hand. Above her and beneath the bracket arm from the pilaster a rectangular projection with two faces in double outline may represent a lintel rather than a balcony. Beside Dīpaṃkara and looking away from him stands Vajrapāṇi with short hair, a short lower garment, powerful arms and torso with horizontal bands of musculature; one hand is on his hip, the other holds the bottom of a long vertical vajra between thumb and finger(s). Another, monastic figure faces him. Below the top of the panel are three complete tops of spectators with chignon and tunic and the vestige probably of another. All the heads are long and oval, the features sharp and the eyes rounded. At one side a sharply cut pilaster, the shaft with a recessed oblong panel with curved top and bottom, has a Corinthian capital under a capital with sawtooth enrichment and one voluted bracket arm and, below, the usual and summarily moulded base. The pilaster continues on the return but the bracket capital extends to the edge of the Corinthian capital only. Above the panel and also continued on the return runs a cavetto with acanthus leaves, each with a drooping lobe in the middle and lobes at the sides with points meeting those of the next leaf.
The third scene down of the upright shows perhaps the Intervention of Ānanda. The haloed Buddha sits with his over-robe covering both shoulders and forming a high neckline; an edge in relief falls from the arm of his abhaya hand and joins the gathered drapery from his left above the lap. His neck and head are long and the high uṣṇīṣa of wavy hair is secured by a fillet. The strewn seat is plain and high, and leafy branches hang down beside the halo. On the Buddha's left a woman in almost frontal position with a small chignon and fillet, a garment passing over her left shoulder, a paridhāna round it, and a scarf over her left arm looped into the girdle and anklets, holds a cylinder bound horizontally at the top, middle and bottom, perhaps a garland of flowers suspended by a cord rather than a cylindrical vessel as offering to the Buddha. Between them appears to be a figure with wreath headdress and beyond both a damaged male lay figure in uttarīya and with joined hands. Above them are half-length figures, one with a chignon and another in a turban. On the Buddha's right are two monks, both with their right shoulder uncovered and one in discourse with the Buddha, his right hand before his chest, his pendent left under the robe, the other with hands joined. Three half-length figures, two with crested turbans, look on above and beside them.
The fourth scene down of the upright shows the Buddha before a doorway. The haloed Buddha, almost the height of the frame, one hand in abhaya, the other, which is damaged, to his side, his over-robe covering both shoulders and with a tight neckline, stands slightly turned to his left, his hair like stray locks under a tight uṣṇīṣa. Above him a celestial holds a wreath, the edge marked with petals. Beside the Buddha a figure, in crested turban and uttarīya in the wide mode and a gathered robe end swinging away, stands elegantly in front of a doorway pointing to it. In between them the head, with chignon, of a robed celestial looks on. The oblique doorway is lower within its moulded architraves than the figure in front of it and its door of two panelled leaves appears partly open. Above the doorway triangular loopholes and a balcony projecting on brackets must belong to the same building. Beside the Buddha, Vajrapāṇi, partly turned away, wears his uttarīya in the wide mode and holds his vajra at a slant at the left shoulder; his hair is short. Beside him a monk has his right arm wound in the robe but apparently no hand emerges. Above them are two half-length celestials, one looking outward, robed over both shoulders, the other seen in three-quarter view from behind, with long hair, a chignon and an uttarīya; he extends a damaged arm, evidently to hold, with the figure opposite, the Buddha's wreath.

Common to traditions of the Buddha's first visit to Kapilavastu is the intervention of Udāyī; according to one, when the Buddha was at the Bamboo Grove at Rājagṛha soon after the Enlightenment, his father Śuddhodana sent Kālodāyī or Udāyī the Black together with the groom Chandaka to invite him and 'with bent knees and bowed head Kālodāyī implored the infinite One'. They became monks and, at a suitable season for travelling, persuaded the Buddha to return to Kapilavastu. In the Pāli and Mūlasarvāstivadin traditions repeated failed embassies were followed by the success of Udāyī alone who invited the Buddha to Kapilavastu, himself becoming a monk, in the latter tradition after Buddha's assent to Śuddhodana's letter.

Drapery folds on all the figures and the wings of the spirits or kiṃnaras show dense grooves which recall the early 'drawing' style of Butkara. 
In a number of instances a disc, radiate or plain, receives worship in a context where the cult object is often an attribute such as the Buddha's turban or bowl. Occurring on caitya arch friezes or over the upper compartment of false gables, these cases have encouraged the interpretation, extended to a Mathurā panel, that the disc, in order to qualify as attribute of Buddha, should be a halo. But discs occur in a more varied range of examples and many appear rather to symbolise the Buddha himself, especially in connection with events of the First Sermon. Thus the present scene becomes more probably an episode from that cycle; some examples, as if the force of the symbol is insufficient, show a pair of knees behind the disc, yet others the disc with the Buddha also, and yet others again a disc with another symbol, such as the three wheels or a tree.
For the disc as the Buddha's halo see Pal, 1984: 139, and Carter, 1988b: 29. A proposal to identify the disc as a solar symbol of the Buddha is based on a sky- and fire-symbolism connected with concepts of ascent and personal liberation (Enlightenment), return and salvation (First Sermon).",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Green schist, broken, chipped and worn.

This distinguishing feature may be compared with the extended hand of a monk on the Buddha's right on Calcutta 5054, in whom Foucher (1905-51: I, 433) would like to see Ājñātakauṇḍinya, the first arhat; see also Faccenna-Taddei, 1962-4: I, 20 ad pl. LIVa. One monk, now almost headless, between two on the Buddha's right and with no visible seat, makes up the traditional five. Their robes lie in straight or semi-circular edges between the knees, and the faces of their seats have hatched or triangular patterns. Above the monks and beside the tree, celestials with long hair, a chignon, an uttarīya, a collar, earrings and bracelets join their hands or raise them to throw bunches of flowers. One, between two monks on the right, balances the monk opposite.
All the heads are oval, with emphasised chins and lower lips and rounded protruding eyes, and the tonsured monks have a hairline. Compare in general, and in such details as the angle of the first monk's head on the Buddha's left, Peshawar 1716.4
Framing the panel at the top is a register between fillets of acanthus leaves with drooping central lobes and flanking points joining those of adjacent leaves. Defining the bottom are mouldings with sawtooth enrichment, except where cramp mortises were perhaps subsequently made at the expense of the ornament.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Height: 27 centimetres; Weight: 8.60 kilograms; Width: 32 centimetres; Depth: 7 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The Buddha set rolling the Wheel of the Doctrine with his First Sermon to the five ascetics, always shown as monks, in the Deer Park outside Benares. They and numerous deities were converted and rejoicing gods reported that he had set rolling the thrice-revolved and twelvefold wheel of the Dharma.
In Gandhāra the wheel of this scene is found in a variety of positions against or beside the Buddha's seat, very often distinctly to the left to be beneath the Buddha's right hand; the deer beside it symbolise the location. No tree is mentioned in the texts but, although on the sculptures there is always one behind the Buddha, it varies and, like the deer, must, if more vaguely, refer to the setting. The auditors are usually five or fewer monks, often seated at an oblique angle; and various figures, of deities and of Vajrapāṇi, are used to balance the composition of a central Buddha and an uneven number of monks.
This is almost certainly the panel discussed in Barger and Wright, 1941: 20, as having pīpal leaves, celestials and the earth-touching gesture referable to the Enlightenment, while the monks and the wheel-and-deer belong to the First Sermon: the iconography is therefore deemed composite as on V & A I.M- 70 to C-1939 (Ackermann, 1975: pl. LXXXIa) with the same anachronistic combination of monks and pipal leaves.; Zwalf 1985
After the Enlightenment at Bodh Gayā, Gautama, now a Buddha, went to the Deer Garden at Sārnāth, near Benares, and preached his First Sermon, expressed as 'setting in motion the Wheel of the Doctrine', to the five ascetics who had shared his quest and privations. Before his seat is a symbolic wheel flanked by deer; around him sit the ascetics as monks, one making a gesture of benediction or acceptance, and gods beside a tree rejoice.","Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Cocheteux & Takahashi 1995 / Sérinde, Terre de Bouddha.

The Buddha in abhaya, wearing over both shoulders an over-robe with a wide neckline in relief, secures the robe above his lap in his left hand while the usual gathered drapery spreads below. His chest is broad and almost flat. His wavy hair continues into a large uṣṇīṣa which is tied at its base by a band with a central clasp or jewel; his eyes are rounded and protruding and the upper lip has a small moustache. Over the halo, plain save for an inner groove along the edge, is a canopy of damaged branches. The strewn seat is plain save for a moulding and stands on a rocky surface with peaks; the radiate patches, which may be vegetation, and a lion's head and fore-paws protruding from a cave are taken as conventional attributes of wild and mountainous terrain. Beside the Buddha's right shoulder a half-length Vajrapāṇi leans forward, bearded and with long hair, a garment over both shoulders and a vajra held against his right shoulder. Below him a kneeling ascetic with long hair and a chignon, a tunic with a scalloped upper edge turned down and the right shoulder bare, raises one hand to the top of his head and holds a water bottle in the other. Behind him stand two other ascetics, both similarly dressed, one with a chignon, long hair and a beard sprouting from his chin, the other younger; both join their hands. The kneeling ascetic opposite is like the first; a similarly dressed headless figure stands behind him while a younger figure above, with long hair and a chignon, wears an uttarīya; the latter two join their hands.

This scene may represent the story of Bāvarī's sixteen pupils or Pārāyaṇika brāhmaṇas. An ascetic named Bāvarī, distressed on account of a curse, was consoled by a female spirit and sent sixteen of his disciples with their following to test the Buddha's Buddhahood by certain questions, and they duly became arhats; the Buddha then appeared before Bāvarī, who also became an arhat.
A number of sculptures have been referred to this story; a mountainous context is common to most, which either situate the Buddha in a cave, as in the Visit of Indra, or on an uneven rocky surface, and the ascetics adopt mannered and indeed dejected postures; the gesture of touching the head, which here suggests a salutation, seems elsewhere like burying the head in one hand. For the presence of guardian figures see Raducha, 1985a, who considers that BM 1965.0801.5 may have a connection with this subject.
A previous explanation of this scene, the preaching of the Sermon on the Senses to the Kāśyapas after their conversion, was proposed for this panel on account of the mountainous setting and its possible equation with Gayāsīrṣa (Gayāsisa). The ascetic appearance of the Kāśyapas after their conversion would be anachronistic, but for a comparable problem in respect of BM 1899.0609.21 see Foucher, 1905-51: II, 274-5.; Zwalf 1985
Seated on a hill, the Buddha may be preaching to some of his first converts, the Kāśyapa hermits, still shown long-haired. In the Pali tradition the Buddha is said to have addressed them, after they had become monks, on Mount Gayā (Gayāśīrṣa). 'Everything is burning . . . with the fire of lust. . . of anger . . . of ignorance. . . . Considering this . . . becoming weary of all that [the disciple] divests himself of passion ... is made free. . . . He becomes aware that he is free . . . and that there is no further return to this world.'",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

A cult of the turban should presuppose the story of the Bodhisattva's tonsure after the Great Departure. With a sword he cut off his locks (cudā), or locks together with a crest or turban (moli and cūḷāmaṇiveṭhana), crown (mukuṭa) or Mani pearl gem which were taken by Indra and honoured among the Thirty-Three Gods. The ascension, enshrinement and worship of a turban are found on sculpture outside Gandhāra, and in Gandhāra a turban, shown apparently as a cult object, is a persistent motif in sculpture. While the episode of the tonsure itself is scarcely represented in Gandhāra, the turban is brought to the Bodhisattva as he leaves the palace and occurs exceptionally as part of the Exchange of Clothing and when Chandaka returns with it to Kapilavastu.
The present piece may show the Bodhisattva or the Buddha instructing a deity in the worship of the turban or it may have some connection with concepts of royal consecration (abhiṣeka) and more specifically as extended to the final stage of a Bodhisattva's ascent, known also by the term abhiṣeka.

His abhaya gesture is all but lost. He stands in the middle on a triple stair of two treads, the central stair facing the viewer, the two flanking at an angle with the risers sloping inwards. Beside the Buddha on the flanking stairs are Indra on his left and Brahmā, both with hands joined and in uttarīya and paridhāna, Indra with ornaments. Brahmā's hair is long under a chignon with a horizontal length of hair with one end looped and one hanging down onto the forehead. Beside him at ground level two similar figures of diminishing size, hands joined, share his simpler appearance; those occupying the upper part of the panel wear ornaments and one is about to throw flowers, another has a bag at the waist from which he prepares to extract flowers, and between them a small Vajrapāṇi with a chignon to one side holds a short vajra. Kneeling beneath Brahmā and beside the central stair a figure with a bare right shoulder, a long garment and hands joined must be the nun Utpalavarṇa. Indra, on the Buddha's left, joins his hands and wears an uttarīya looped in higher relief below the waist, a bracelet, a collar, earrings and a headdress which combines a turban of cross-hatched pattern with a cylindrical top and vertical jewelled bands. Beside him two figures of diminishing size with hands joined, collars, bracelets and an uttarīya, one of whom wears a crested turban, the other a double-looped chignon, balance the pair opposite.

After the Buddha had taught his mother and the gods in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, he returned to Jambudvīpa, surrounded by gods, at Sāṃkāśya and there was a magnificent display of men, gods and of a cakravartin magically created by (the nun) Utpalavarṇā. The tradition that he came down on a central ladder flanked by Indra and Brahmā, each on his own ladder, and accompanied by deities, is, with variations, found in Pāli and sources of northern origin. Usually in the texts Brahmā's ladder is of silver and Indra's of jewels and they are on the right and left respectively; the monuments seem to agree that these positions are with reference to the Buddha. At their foot the Buddha was greeted, in the Pāli tradition, by Śāriputra and Utpalavarṇā.

In the right-hand scene the Buddha, towering over all other figures, has to his left Vajrapāṇi, and above and between them is a half-length onlooker in a crested turban. The damaged Vajrapāṇi holds his right hand to his hip and the vajra vertically in his left hand and appears to be looking up at the Buddha. His torso is muscular, his arms and legs very slender and his short lower garment is densely pleated and hangs with a thick excess of cloth between the legs. The Buddha's over-robe, covering both shoulders, apparently conceals his hands; he stands, head lowered, right hand raised to touch that of the striding male figure who, as he advances, holds up a flower or flowers; he is seen from the back and the head, hair clearly short, looks upwards and sideways over the left shoulder. He wears a uttarīya and paridhāna. A young woman, wearing ornaments, stands turned towards him, her right wrist perhaps held by the male figure, while her left hand brings its index finger to her mouth. She wears a garment passing over her left shoulder, a paridhāna round it and a scarf draped round the elbows as it falls from the headdress, which seems to consist of a wreath with a flower to the front and a coil and loop of hair above it. Beside her, almost full-length save for the legs, is a spectator or deity with long hair in a chignon and an uttarīya worn wrapped round the right arm.
In the incomplete scene a male figure kneels, one knee only on the ground which the head, showing a chignon, almost touches, back curved and wearing only a paridhāna, in front of a woman who appears to emerge from a doorway oblique to the scene, hands joined, dressed like the woman in the right-hand scene except for the single wreath of her headdress. A third figure, wearing an uttarīya and a turban with a crest on its side, turns beside the door towards the tall Buddha who appears almost compressed between the upper and lower frames, his head inclined and his damaged right hand held across the body while his left hangs free of the garment. Above the doorway is an ornamental cornice of lotus petals pointing upwards, but the architraves are too worn to show clearly whether they have ornament.
The framed columns have the usual base and a Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts.

The eyes of the figures are shown as rounded and protruding, except for those of the Buddha which are thin narrow slits between lids. Noteworthy are the naturalistic treatment of Vajrapāṇi's torso and the bold use of the partial back view in the right-hand scene.
It is tempting to see here perhaps a rare Dīpaṃkara sequence in two successive and separate frames as against the preponderance of representations using continuous narration. The transactions with the Buddha and the young woman are, however, obscure, and the young male appears to lack a chignon in the first scene and might be thought, if he were Megha, to have loosened his hair in the second where it still seems short. Compare BM 1880.68, 1980.0225.1, 1880.208, 1899.0715.11 and 1892.0801.7. Identification must remain in doubt, although the two scenes may well be connected.
In an early photograph this fragment seems to be in the same condition as now and appears together with BM 1880.103.

The present and following pieces appear to fit the same circumference (c 4.75 m) and show similarities of treatment, especially of the male in three-quarter view with mannered prominence of his buttocks, but the difference in the base of the divider column in the following piece is noteworthy.

To distinguish between compositions with the three wheels (an innovation confined to Gandhāra) as cult object and as symbolising the First Sermon, Foucher, 1905-51: I, 427-31, proposed that the presence of deer, even when flanking and worshipping monks are standing and kneeling rather than seated, indicated the latter, but instances are now known which may favour grouping scenes with the three wheels, but lacking the deer, more closely with the cycle of the First Sermon. This may appear from Taxila Kn. '32-302, an incomplete panel apparently in the usual iconography but without deer (Marshall, 1951: n, 717-18, no. 119, III, pl. 220, no. 119), from the apparently narrative context provided by a harmikā and from single panels among which the Buddha himself may stand beside the three wheels and in many cases turns or touches another wheel or disc, while monks bring a seat as on BM 1940.0713.4 in connection with BM 1914.0502.1. Also common are the simultaneous representation of the three wheels and a single wheel or floral disc in the combination of 'trident' over disc, and here deer are also sporadically present.
The symbolism of the three wheels has been explained by Benisti, 1977, 65-6, with textual references, not as the Three jewels of Buddhism but as an allusion to the three turnings of the wheel at the First Sermon. In the many different examples of scenes with the three wheels, the meaning may seem to vary between a representation of the Doctrine in its First Sermon aspect and one which is more rather than less narrative, with the Buddha present and turning or touching a wheel or disc and sometimes a monk bringing a seat. In both cases the monks are worshippers instead of auditors. Unless five monks were certain, the present example would seem to be rather of the former type.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"2010/11 14 Oct- 3 Apr, London BM, Images and Sacred Texts: Buddhism across Asia","1.Grey schist, broken and exfoliated.

Lying on his side, head turned to his right and feet away from each other, the Buddha holds his right hand, apparently emerging from the high neckline, as if in abhaya below his head and against the bordered halo. His left hand is covered by the robe, which continues in pleats below it. The hair is wavy into the uṣṇīṣa, the long oval face has partly open, expressionless eyes.

The features are sharply, if clumsily, carved, the faces sometimes heavy, the noses prominent and broad and the mouths set back between jowls.
The Indian texts agree substantially over the Buddha's last days. He became seriously ill near Vaiśālī but was able to reach the Malla country, near Kuśinagara, where Cunda, the smith, prepared him the mysterious sūkaramaddava which again made him ill. Proceeding to Kuśinagara, he lay down on his right side between two sāla trees, his head to the north, and the trees flowered unseasonably. Ānanda attended, grieving, gods assembled and the Mallas of Kuśinagara were summoned, coming in great numbers. The ascetic Subhadra was the Buddha's last convert. When the Buddha was dead, Brahmā, Indra and the monk Anuruddha (Aniruddha) recited verses, monks grieved and the Mallas came to honour his body. They could not lift it for the cremation until Anuruddha had indicated the gods' wishes and it would not burn until Mahākāśyapa, informed on the road by an ājīwika, had arrived with his followers and it then caught fire spontaneously. The Mallas took possession of the remains and would yield none to claimants among the neighbouring tribes who prepared to fight, until a brāhmaṇa had effected a peaceable division; then each erected a stupa in his own territory to enshrine a share.
In representations of the Great Decease the usually haloed Buddha lies invariably on his right side, his covered left hand down his side, the right palm outwards beside the head; a leg can be flexed and the drapery may hang as on a standing figure. The bed, with turned or carved legs, may have a mattress and pillow and a textile, sometimes decorated, hanging between the legs; a small stool also occurs. At each side one of the traditional pair of sāla is represented by a tree, commonly with evenly paired leaves on the branches, and there may be more. Attendants may include Brahmā and Indra, usually Vajrapāṇi, figures indistinguishably gods or Mallas unless, as in Calcutta 5147, they are half-length and flying figures and throwing flowers, and monks identified as Ananda, Anuruddha and Mahākāśyapa. Vajrapāṇi stands at the head of the bed as here and in the following piece, or behind it, or lies beside it, raising one arm in a gesture of grief or holding it across the top of his head. Usually at the foot of the bed is a figure with a wrapped head and a triple staff (tridaṇḍa) or a monk with or without monastic staff, the monk sometimes touching the Buddha's feet or in conversation with a naked and tonsured figure, while the figure with the triple staff, the tridaṇḍin, may be talking with a monk behind or beside the couch. To explain this confusing alternation it has been proposed that the monk behind or beside the couch may be informing the tridaṇḍin of the momentous event or he may, by a use of continuous narration, be Mahākāśyapa, who arrived seven days after the death, learning of it on the road from an ājīvika, the naked and tonsured figure, or, in a sculptural tradition found on Gandhāra reliefs, from another kind of heretical personage instead, the tridaṇḍin. Sometimes a standing monk helps up another; they are identified as Anuruddha and Ānanda. Another figure, variously seated, facing, with back to the viewer or in three-quarter view, and sometimes tonsured, as here, and sometimes with his head covered is identified as Subhadra, the last convert. When this figure has beside him a tripod of three sticks tied to each other to support a suspended bag, explained as a water bag, the reference must be to Subhadra's previous character as a parivrājaka ascetic.",Srinivasan 1997 / Gandharan Textiles: a Local Craft with a Western Connection; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/dc51a/s3),"Exhibited:

She is flanked by three women similarly dressed and adorned, their hairstyles varying slightly with the style of the diadem and the height of the chignon. One of them raises a hand with the index and middle fingers joined, another is dressing Sundarī's hair, while a third looks on, almost as if from above. All three have expressively smiling and eager faces, their eyes wide open; a fourth, similarly dressed, stands in a side chamber with one hand raised, her eyes narrow and looking down. The mirror is on a turned stand beside a covered unguent box on a table resting on a Corinthian capital, its lost pedestal supported on a stand of curved legs. Hanging from floral stems, a wreath encloses a bag. In the side chamber beside the door, Sundarananda, haloed and with a chignon, collar, earrings and bracelet, wearing an uttarīya and a paridhāna, carries a bowl and looks back over his shoulder. He reappears in continuous narration just beyond a doorway, kneeling, still holding the bowl and with head raised towards the tall and haloed Buddha who looks down at him.

The Buddha is on his begging round at Kapilavastu and his half-brother Sundarananda (or Nanda), made to carry the Buddha's bowl and urged to return soon by Sundarī, follows him reluctantly, is prevented from returning and, though unwilling, accepts to be ordained. His true conversion occurs later after the Buddha, by his magic power, has made him see the superiority over Sundarī of the apsarases of Indra's heaven and he is then shamed by an elder of the community out of trying to possess them by the power derived from the practice of austerities. Before taking him to Indra's heaven the Buddha caught him attempting to escape by causing the tree behind which he was hidden to rise in the air.","Simpson 1894 / The classical influence in the architecture of the Indus region and Afghanistan; Nara 1991 / NHK Daiei Hakubutsukan 4: Indo, Bukkyo bijutsu no Kaika; Errington & Cribb 1992 / The Crossroads of Asia  [Cat. of an exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge]; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum; Rawson 1984 / Chinese Ornament: The Lotus and the Dragon; Errington 2017a / Charles Masson and the Buddhist Sites of Afghanistan: Explorations, Excavations, Collections 1832-1835",Not on display,,"1.Limestone, broken, chipped, rejoined from three pieces and with bottom left pilaster base restored.

The haloed Buddha, filling the height of the scene, turns looking sideways and down and leaning somewhat forward, his right hand and arm stretched out before him, palm inwards, while the left hand holds an empty bowl sideways and open to the viewer. The over-robe covering both shoulders with a high, slightly pointed neckline hangs with edges in relief from the right forearm and in a dense fall from the left wrist, and reveals more of the lower undergarment but less of the upper than is usual. The drapery folds are regular and densely rounded ridges. The hair undulates into the large uṣṇīṣa. Beneath the bowl a standing child, almost naked save for a cloak round the neck and hanging down the back, a low girdle, bracelets and anklets, wears earrings and a fillet above his short border of curls and holds out both hands on which apparently lies a flat cake. Beside him another similar child, naked except for ornaments, hair with a low chignon, sits cross-legged on a moulded threshold or plinth with damaged hands joined.
Above the standing child are two half-length turbaned figures, one above the other, both wearing ornaments and an uttarīya. Also on the threshold and framed in an oblique and fasciated doorway with a hint of sloping jambs stands a woman wearing a diaphanous sleeved blouse, a garment over her left shoulder and a paridhāna round it, a cross-hatched wreath-and-large-flower headdress with a loop of hair projecting above it, and the usual ornaments; instead of the palm branch she holds peacock feathers in a cylindrical mount upright in her left hand while her damaged right hand is raised. The lintel is enriched with a sawtooth pattern under a cavetto cornice of vertically grooved lotus petals and above it is a balcony draped in a textile. On the balcony are two women like the one below, one raising an arm to throw flowers. While the oblique doorway may suggest a variation of depth, the balcony is entirely frontal and the threshold almost so.
Beside the Buddha a Vajrapāṇi of Hermes type, with one flexed leg, turns away towards a monk; he is naked except for a draped overgarment looping below the plump thighs and revealing an otherwise svelte figure with modelled chest, one damaged arm raised, the other cupped under the rounded bottom of his vajra. His hair is short with corkscrew curls below the fillet. The monk's tonsure shows a hairline, the over-robe covers both shoulders, his right hand is covered, the other resting on the chest.

Having dismissed Chandaka and Kaṇṭhaka and cut off his hair, the Bodhisattva, wishing to adopt more suitable garments, exchanged his Benares silk for the rougher clothes of a hunter.While the Tonsure may occur before the Farewell from the horse (Buddhacarita, Saṃghabhedavastu, Mahāvastu), the adoption of rough clothing, although in some accounts previous to the departure of the groom and horse (Buddhacarita, Jātaka Introduction), is the Bodhisattva's last act in this sequence of events. The Tonsure appears to occur only once in Gandhāra, on a limestone relief from Qunduz where the order of events is: the Farewell, the Tonsure and the Exchange of Clothing (Fischer, 1958: 238, fig. 4). For the Exchange see Lalitavistara XV. l.255-6 (Foucaux, 1884: 197); Mahāvastu II. 189, 195; Bareau, 1962b: 22. In Saṃghabhedavastu 1.92-3 the exchange is with Indra dressed as a hunter (compare Rockhill, 1907: 26) and the Bodhisattva by his power makes the rougher clothes fit. In the Jātaka Introduction his friend from a former birth, the Mahābrahmā Ghaṭīkara, gave him the eight necessaries of a monk (Fausboll, 1877-97: I, 65, translated Rhys Davids, 1925: 178).

The carving is everywhere summary and the figures are crude; few details are altogether certain. The old ṛṣi Asita, who lived in the Himalaya with his nephew Naradatta, on perceiving signs that the Bodhisattva had been born, predicted to Naradatta the child's destiny as Buddha or cakravartin. They then went to Kapilavastu; Śuddhodana brought the child and Asita examined him and held him in his lap, weeping at the realisation that he would not live to benefit spiritually from the child's certain Buddhahood. The Pāli tradition is very similar.
The presentation of the infant Bodhisattva to Asita follows the formula of the Interpretation of the Dream (see BM 1931.0711.1) and shares variations with it; in the presentation, however, together with an old ascetic who, unlike the old man in the Interpretation, is properly Asita, seated to the left and with his youthful attendant or nephew Naradatta behind, an infant must be present and Asita usually holds it; the seated parents make various gestures and a figure stands in between, holding the infant or presumably just having done so. Altogether exceptional here are the figures with water pot and branch, attributes regularly associated with the Birth; if the parents were ever present, they must have been on the preceding panel on the stupa drum. 
The elephant in this unusual combination may be explained by reference to the Youth cycle: when the now youthful Bodhisattva is about to show his martial skills, a large white elephant is brought to Kapilavastu and Devadatta kills it out of jealousy.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/dc9b/s1),,"1.Grey schist, broken, worn and cracked.

In the next scene a woman with the usual ornaments stands with ankles crossed and holding a handled water pot and very damaged palm branch beside a standing male, very similar to the seated figure in the preceding scene, who appears to be lifting the elephant by the tail. Two figures in varied postures behind the elephant, one probably in uttarīya and both with similar hairstyle, appear each to raise the index and middle fingers of the right hand in a gesture like the benedictio latina, while a third and similar figure raises one hand to the mouth and the other to wave a cloth in astonishment.

A tall figure next to him in uttarīya, collar, earring, bracelet and turban joins damaged hands.
In the next scene a stupa on a rectangular base has columns at the four corners, those at the back indicated by repeating in low relief the capital elements only. On the side of the base, above the plinth, is a diaper of four-petalled flowers, while the columns have plain shafts under flattened globular capital elements horizontally grooved. The two large drums, the upper drum set back above the lower, are enriched with acanthus and support a dome with a barely visible false gable panel on the side, a vedikā register at the bottom, and a lotus with stamens above. The damaged harmikā is surmounted by a tapering spire of four parasols and a finial with pleated banners on either side. Beside the stupa are worshippers in crested turban, ornaments, uttarīya and paridhāna; the farthest from the stupa is holding a reliquary, while the two beside it join their hands.

On the Buddha's left stands a monk, his hairline barely visible and his robe, with paired grooves defining folds, worn with one shoulder bare and the upper undergarment visible. Two monks are seated behind him, both with hands covered in the over-robe, which has a raised and slightly pointed neckline, broad ridges or grooves for garment folds, and lies spread in a straight edge below the lap. Their obliquely placed and strewn rectangular seats have a moulded plinth and scrolled pattern on one face and triangles containing each a small indented triangle on the other. Above them are three turbaned figures like those opposite but holding flowers in large bunches or on a stalk in one hand. They all have protruding rounded eyes and crude features while the other figures on the panel have open eyes and better-cut faces with hints of expressions.

When Mahāprajāpati and other women asked the Buddha to admit them to the Order, then entirely male, he refused; in yellow robes and tonsured, they appealed unsuccessfully again, Ānanda interceded and the Buddha, though relenting, imposed more stringent conditions of discipline upon nuns than those binding monks.
Since Foucher's provisional recognition of this subject on the present panel, without explanation of the vessel, more examples which might be grouped with it have been noted, but a conclusive identification remains desirable. Foucher himself observed that the women had already adopted monastic dress when Ānanda interceded for them and supposed that their lay appearance on the panels might be deliberate to ensure recognition of the subject and to avoid the confusion caused by the similar appearance of monks and nuns.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,On display (G33/dc50b/s3),,"1.Grey schist, with light surface damage and soil incrustation.

(Object),,,"Panel showing the Dīpaṃkara jātaka in three incidents. On the left an oblique doorway with sloping jambs contains a young woman looking up and holding a pot under one arm; the other, with flowers, is raised. She wears a wreath headdress with a projecting loop of hair and a flower, earrings, a collar, bracelets and anklets, a thin sleeved blouse shown by small folds at the shoulders, a garment over the left shoulder and a scarf looping into the girdle of her paridhāna. Above the door is a draped balcony with two women similarly dressed, one with arm raised to throw flowers onto the scene below. Beyond the doorway a large figure of the brāhmaṇa student Megha, in a similar posture to the young woman's, holds a small water pot and raises his right arm to throw flowers towards the Buddha Dīpaṃkara; he wears a girt animal-skin lower garment, an uttarīya over the left shoulder, the brāhmaṇa's sacrificial thread and long hair under a horizontal length of hair looped at one end. The bare torso shows rounded breasts and abdomen, the left knee is flexed and the head is oval with open eyes between the lids. Below, the same figure is shown prostrate, the back, with its flattened planes, arched above the ground, one arm and leg carried onto the lower frame and the hair clearly being spread onto the ground with Megha's left hand; his left arm continues the angular outline of the back. Above and beside the balcony is a radiate aureole showing Megha in low relief, kneeling, his right knee on the ground, hands joined, his hair now fastened into a chignon.
In front of Megha is the damaged Buddha Dīpaṃkara shown as larger than all the other figures, wearing the usual monastic garments with neckline in relief. He raises his large right hand with long fingers in abhaya, his body a gentle curve. Behind him are the half-length figure of a monk observing and an armed figure standing in almost three-quarter view, lower legs crossed, back turned to the viewer. His long hair is secured by a fillet and his curving moustache on the upturned face conveys, with his rounded staring eyes, a fierce expression. He holds his long sword by its pommel, the scabbard is suspended through the bridge at its middle from his right shoulder by a baldrick which continues round the front of the body; a short lower garment is secured by a girdle. The doorway has a sawtooth enrichment on the inner jambs, a cavetto cornice with vertically grooved lotus-petal ornament and a beam protruding at the left.
The frame consists of a sawtooth cornice and at one side a pilaster with a Corinthian capital in two distinct parts, the upper, with central leaf and corners, rather high under an upper capital of two tiers with sawtooth enrichment; on the shaft a garland with narrow ends hangs without visible attachment and under the usual base mouldings seems to be a second plinth. The plain framing fillet at the bottom is grooved as if in continuation of Megha's hair, but see also under the pilaster.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Height: 42.20 centimetres with dowl ; Height: 40.30 centimetres without dowl ; Width: 47.90 centimetres; Depth: 9.50 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
In the frame of the extended story in the Mahāvastu of Dīpaṃkara, Buddha Śākyamuni's predecessor, many details parallel the legend of Śākyamuni, but the king is Arcimat and the city Dīpavatī; the Bodhisattva whose Buddhahood as Śākyamuni Dīpaṃkara predicts is Megha. Megha saw Dīpavatī in festive array and learnt from a brāhmaṇa girl, Prakṛti, that Dīpaṃkara was awaited. From her he obtained, also to honour Dīpaṃkara, five of the flowers she was carrying in a pitcher in return for marriage in future births, a condition without effect on the Bodhisattva vow he made on seeing Dīpaṃkara arriving in procession; both Megha and Prakṛti threw their flowers which remained suspended all around Dīpaṃkara's head, stalks turned inwards, Megha spread his robe on the ground, threw himself at Dīpaṃkara's feet and wiped their soles with his hair as he made his vow. As Dīpaṃkara predicted its fulfilment, Megha rose to the height of a palm tree, threw his cloak over one shoulder and joined his hands in homage. In the Pāli tradition the Bodhisattva, Sumedha of Amaravatī, joined in preparing the road for Dīpaṃkara's visit to the town of Ramma(ka) or Rammavatī and, on seeing Dīpaṃkara, spread his mantle and hair, lay down in the mire like a bridge of planks and resolved to become a Buddha rather than reach only Nirvāṇa. Dīpaṃkara foretold that he should be Śākyamuni and offered him eight handfuls of flowers. The summary account in the Dhammapada Commentary to vv. 11-12 omits any Bodhisattva vow and instead makes the act one of especial courtesy (translated Burlingame, 1921: I, 193-4).
With no sure exceptions [Peshawar 1847 (Ingholt, 1957: fig. 188) may seem to be an exception], representations of this theme use continuous narration and Megha can appear up to four times when he obtains flowers from the girl, throws them, lies prostrate and levitates. His commonest appearances are throwing flowers and lying prostrate, while the transaction with the girl is often implied by her presence as onlooker, usually on the left of the panel and often framed in a doorway; Megha also usually faces Dīpaṃkara from the same direction, and when levitating he may kneel, sometimes in a halo, as in this panel, or is apparently upright, but examples of an almost horizontal flying figure seem confined to Japanese collections. In some instances Megha's hair is clearly spread below Dīpaṃkara's feet, but Foucher distinguishes Dīpaṃkara's treading on it, as in the Divyāvadāna, and Megha's wiping Dīpaṃkara's feet as in the Mahāvastu, which is shown by Megha's hand on Dīpaṃkara's ankle. Dīpaṃkara is accompanied by one or more of his monks (both Mahāvastu 1.231 and Divyāvadāna (c.250) refer to large numbers), but Vajrapāṇi is not invariable.
Megha is the name used for the brāhmaṇa student in the Mahāvastu account; in the Divyāvadāna he is Sumati and in the Pāli account Sumedha. In the completely different frame-story of the Divyāvadāna (Dharmarucyavadāna) c.246-53 the king is Dīpa, the city Dīpavatī and the future Bodhisattva is Sumati. All flowers at Dīpavatī had been requisitioned by Dīpa to honour Dīpaṃkara, but the lotuses in a young woman's pitcher rose up through Sumati's merits and she gave him five, keeping two, in return for the promise of marriage in all future births. When thrown, their flowers formed circular canopies that moved or stood with Dīpaṃkara, and in a muddy place Sumati asked Dīpaṃkara to stand on his ascetic's hair (jaṭā) in token of Sumati's future Buddhahood; when Dīpaṃkara did so and affirmed it, Sumati rose the height of seven fan-palm trees.

A head only, with similar hairstyle, looks between her and the king towards Asita. Śuddhodana wears his uttarīya in the narrow mode showing a muscular chest, paridhāna, collar, earrings and crested turban. Both rest their feet on ornamented footstools and raise their right hands; Śuddhodana's, at right angles to himself, just touches the raised right of Asita, while Māyā's damaged right arm seems to be held against the shoulder. Asita, who is seated on a draped, round cane stool, wears an uttarīya, is bearded and has a coiled chignon. A male head with diadem looks down at them.

Once clear of Kapilavastu, the Bodhisattva handed his jewels and parasol to Chandaka, cut off his hair and bade the groom and the horse depart. The horse licked his feet, but the Bodhisattva went away, paying no attention. In the Buddhacarita the horse licked the Bodhisattva's feet, shed tears and received consoling words, and in the Saṃghabhedavastu he licked the Bodhisattva's feet, was stroked and consolingly spoken to. The Lalitavistara speaks of a stupa to mark the dismissal, otherwise briefly reported, and while the Pāli tradition of the Jātaka Introduction tells of Kaṇṭhaka's death of grief at the place of parting, in Sanskrit accounts Kaṇṭhaka died of the same cause later and the return of horse and groom to Kapilavastu is recorded in sculpture.

(Object),,,"Panel showing perhaps the departing Viśvaṃtara making a gift. A damaged chariot drawn by two horses holds three persons and the much taller, haloed Bodhisattva. Two figures are badly sliced: at the back is presumably Madrī with what looks like a loop of hair and a flower in the wreath headdress; the middle figure seems to hold the reins with one hand while the other is raised to the top of the head in astonishment; and the third, complete and male, with the ends of the hair waved or rolled over the forehead, and wearing an earring, collar and armlet, stands forward in the chariot with one hand raised to the top of the head and the other holding a bag of treasure for the Bodhisattva to give to the brāhmaṇa.
The Bodhisattva, leaning forward at an angle expressing his eagerness to give, wears armlets, bracelets, collar, earrings and long hair with a chignon at the top and bound back by a fillet. His left hand grasps an indistinct object, perhaps a small bag, while his right hand is raised and stretched out holding a damaged narrow object. It descends indistinguishably into the brāhmaṇa's outstretched hand where it may be interpreted as cascading from an emptying bag. The ascetic is the largest figure, and his head is bowed beneath the upper frame. He wears a girdled paridhāna with paired drapery folds and his long hair is drawn back and raised into a high chignon. His body is supported on a stick and his emaciated side is densely grooved to show a rib cage above the thrust-out abdomen. The eyes are large with big lids, the nose sharply cut and the mouth an asymmetrical line, making the face look wholly ungracious. The centre of the action is emphasised by the undercutting of both forearms.
Behind him, almost frontal, is a young ascetic, the legs crossed below the knees. He has long hair with a chignon, a girdled lower garment, a brāhmaṇa's sacrificial thread, a water pot in his left hand and the right raised to shoulder level, showing the palm below curled fingers. Like the small figure
on the chariot his eyes show a distinct and heavy-lidded treatment which, with the rolled ends of the hair and perhaps paired drapery folds, suggests late and post-Gandhāra work.
The chariot appears to have trellised openwork sides and its large wheel partly emerges behind the nearer horse, which stands exposed along its full length facing the action while the other, inner horse seems to turn to face the viewer. Both are harnessed, the nearer horse with a saddle; the girth, breast-plate and crupper are beaded, the two latter adorned with radiate 'phalerae' or discs; bells hang at the front and the reins are undercut below the mouths. One mane is dressed into a short comb, the other is more abundant. The nearer horse's flat flank emphasises the compressed carving within a restricted space.
On the framing pilasters a haloed meditating Buddha on a lotus seat survives at the front and on both sides of the shaft; the capitals are tall, and the scored base appears to have two plinths. At the top is a plain cornice.",,,,,,,,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 6.50 centimetres; Height: 24.10 centimetres; Width: 55.90 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1985

The story ends happily in the reunion of the family without any loss of merit gained by such sacrifices.

This relief was once part of a larger panel which, in all probability, featured a Buddha figure at the centre and the Bodhisattva Padmapāṇi on the opposite side. The Buddha flanked by two Bodhisattvas was a common arrangement in Buddhist sculpture from early in its history. The representation of Vajrapāṇi shows that his iconography, at least in ancient Gandhāra, was in part derived from Hercules (see 1776.1108.2) who often wears a lion-skin in the same manner, recalling the hero's defeat of the Nemean Lion. Hercules was widely venerated as a hero and saviour in western Asia during the early centuries of the present era. As a great champion, who nevertheless understood the human condition, Hercules was easily assimilated into Mahāyāna Buddhism.
This relief, aside from its interest as a document of religious development, illustrates a well-known phenomenon in the history of art, namely, that images change in meaning before they change in appearance.; Zwalf 1996:
The manner of wearing the lion's skin is common in the iconography of Heracles (see Lexicon, 1981-8: iv, 7281F., 79iff.) and it derives from his slaying of the Nemean lion; the same style was adopted by or for rulers claiming descent from Heracles, among whom was Alexander the Great.

In the Mahāvastu account (II.I 59-64) the Bodhisattva, repelled by the sleeping women, asked Chandaka for his horse and left despite his pleas; no one woke, the gods rained flowers, the earth trembled and the four mahārājas held up Kaṇṭhaka's hooves while Supratiṣṭhita the yakṣa, with his five hundred companions, opened a city gate; wicked Māra grieved, hosts of nāgas and suparṇas escorted the Bodhisattva who, before the sorrowing city-goddess, swore not to reenter the town before his Enlightenment. In the longer Lalitavistara account deities, in a preamble, prepared their various parts and Vaiśravaṇa in particular told the yakṣas to carry the horse's feet while he went ahead, and Indra undertook to open doors and point the way. The gods then showed the women in repellent attitudes and the Bodhisattva, seeing the gods and planets ready, summoned Chandaka; despite his pleas the horse was brought, the city and his wife plunged in sleep, the four mahādrājas and the Trāyastriṃśa gods appeared, Indra and Brahmā showed the way (v. 80) and the city-goddess's lament elicited the same vow (vv.82-93). In the Pāli jātaka Introduction the Bodhisattva looked at his wife and new-born son in the next room before mounting; deities, placing their palms under the hooves, muffled their sound, Channa followed, the deity of the city gate opened it and Māra's dissuasion proved in vain.
Departure scenes fall into two main groups, with frontal departure as above and with horse and rider in profile as on 1939.0119.16; the latter may be varied with a three-quarter view as on 1913.1108.2. Departures in profile go from right to left with a gateway behind the rider. A horizontal Departure cycle on a large scale has been proposed for a building not a stupa at Butkara I.
The frequently armoured figure, often with sword or bow, conducting the rider or pointing the way, either with hand held open or with wand or staff, has been identified as Māra who, in the Jātaka Introduction, attempts to halt the course to Enlightenment, Indra or Vaiśravaṇa; Foucher explains the other armed figures as the five hundred Śākya youths guarding each of the gates of Kapilavastu against the Bodhisattva's departure. The figure with a parasol, usually beside and behind the Bodhisattva, may be Chandaka; the figures emerging from the ground or complete above it and holding the horses' hooves to muffle them are yakṣas except where one or two female figures, identified as the earth-goddess, are recognised, Vajrapāṇi is first seen in this Bodhisattva's career on scenes of the Great Departure and the desponding female with mural crown often leaning her elbow on a post of moulded or architectural form is the nagaradevatā or city-goddess of Kapilavastu.

Connected accounts of the conception or dream of Māyā generally agree in representing Queen Māyā as sleeping and her husband as absent. The Bodhisattva, seen in a dream as an elephant who enters her womb, is superb and white and sometimes six-tusked. The question whether Indian sculptural traditions saw the descent of the Bodhisattva in the form of an elephant as dream or as physical reality has been discussed with reference to the varying testimony of the texts.; Zwalf 1985

Behind them are three half-length figures, one of whom, a haloed deity holding an opening lotus, wears a collar, bracelet and turban showing a crest with a central tapering ornament, while the other two show traces of a turban and a patterned collar.

He is followed by a woman, her straight hair parted and covered by a scarf, her hands joined; she perhaps wears a tunic under a garment draped over her left shoulder.

The haloed Bodhisattva sits touching the bodhimaṇḍa with his right hand from under the over-robe while his left holds high a loop of drapery and a gathered length from the robe below it which falls and spreads onto the seat; the drapery folds on his broad and full chest are shown as wide alternating grooves and ridges. His face is oval and full with the features harmoniously set into it. The branches above have clear pipal leaves and the face of the strewn seat has four panels, diagonally bisected to form triangles each containing an indented triangle, above a simple plinth, while the sides are plain.
On his left presumably Māra, wearing armour as on BM 1899.0609.19,34,68, a paridhāna, a crested turban, earrings and bracelets, prepares to draw his sword from a rectangular scabbard which hangs by a short, straight baldrick from his left shoulder. He is restrained or supported by a youthful figure with short hair beneath a chignon, who wears a collar and a necklace from his right shoulder over his left upper arm and a paridhāna and stands with one ankle across the other; he places one hand on Māra's shoulder and another over the baldrick. Beside them is another figure, with armour like Māra's but no paridhāna, holding a battle-axe below the head, its shaft resting on the ground; his left arm is damaged, and he has a segmented border of hair like ribbed beads. Above them, beside the tree, a horse's head and neck are turned towards the Bodhisattva; around the neck is a broad collar with bell-shaped pendant and the mouth spews flames. Alongside is a human monster with a double face, the upper face with hair, ears, eyes and nose while the moustached lower face has all the features from its hairline to the chin. He appears to have something twisted and in relief passing across his chest and perhaps connected with a damaged area beside him: it may be similar to the unexplained weapon held by a figure beside the tree opposite.
On the other side stands what seems to be the vanquished Māra, dressed as on the right but as if stealing away, both hands, with bracelets, over a sheathed sword, the baldrick coming from the waist and the suspension bridge visible. The scabbard appears to pass under the rolled bottom of the skirt and to be held between the knees. Māra is here apparently supported by the same figure as opposite but the paridhāna is shorter and the necklace runs over the opposite arm, while beside him stands an almost-naked bravo with a loincloth, and muscular legs, carved hourglass-fashion in contrast to the more columnar legs of the corresponding warrior on the opposite side. He has short hair and somewhat brutish features, and holds one damaged hand to the jutting chin while with the other he leans on a club resting on the ground. Above them is a partly animal-headed figure with rounded and protruding eyes and a long thin shaft across its chest beside the tree where the shaft seems to curve and join the foliage. Beside him a half-length horse-headed figure brings one paw or hand to its mouth while the other holds a sword.

Before the Enlightenment and under the bodhi tree the Bodhisattva was tempted by Māra with the pleasures of men, sovereignty and immortality as a god; when they had been rejected, Māra, disregarding the counsel of his son, returned 'in his great armour' with his army of 'frightful and monstrous beasts' who are described in great detail; creatures with such deformities may often be found on the sculpture. The Bodhisattva, after stroking his head and his bent knee, struck the ground thrice, the earth reverberated and Māra's army broke up, its animals stampeded, and the soldiers ran away and fell down in various ways. In the Pāli tradition the Jātaka Introduction also describes the discomfiture of a large army after Māra had mobilised different forces of nature in vain and the Earth had testified to the Bodhisattva's merit.
The above presentation of this theme was interpreted by Foucher, 1905-51: 1, 404-6, as showing Māra as assailant on the Bodhisattva's left and withdrawing discomfited on his right. For a simpler form see BM 1880.227. This presentation may also show Māra supported or, on the Bodhisattva's left, perhaps restrained by a figure that may be one of Māra's virtuous sons mentioned in texts as on this piece; Lahore 1281; Peshawar 128, 2070. The grotesque demons of Māra's army may be disposed as here and on Chandigarh 543 and Washington 49.9, and Māra's defeated soldiers may lie prostrate before the Bodhisattva's throne while Lahore 538, like Peshawar 2042, no doubt belonged to a more complex composition, with the latter showing Māra's three daughters and Māra himself seated at the side. Notwithstanding the textual presence of the earth goddess at this stage and what seems to be the earth-touching (bhūmisparśa) hand gesture invoking her as on this and the following piece, her appearance seems commoner on reliefs showing the events of BM 1895.1018.2. For an example of the present scene with the goddess see Berlin MIK I 10198, and for a fragment where the gesture above her appears to be the dhyānamudrā see Lahore 777 (Ingholt, 1957: 148, fig. 346).

In Mahāvastu II. 314-43, 405-12 certain sons of Māra are well affected towards the Bodhisattva. An even more detailed description of the horrors of Māra's army is in the Lalitavistara XXI, which also tells of those of his sons in it who were favourable to the Bodhisattva being on Māra's right while those hostile were on the left, how his assailants' weapons became flowers, how Māra tempted the Bodhisattva after the assault and the earth-goddess Sthavarā appeared in order to bear witness to the Bodhisattva's merits after he had struck the ground. In the Samghabhedavastu I.115 the earth-goddess makes her homage, the daughters of Māra appear and the army's assault follows their failure. The monsters of Māra's army are also briefly described in Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra (Lamotte, 1944-80: III, 1582) and more fully again in Buddhacarita XIII. In the Lalitavistara the temptation by Māra's daughters follows immediately and another, shorter account, in verse, of Māra's army occurs at the end of the chapter. A subsequent temptation by Māra's daughters is reported in Saṃyuttanikāya I.124 (Feer, 1932: 124-7, translated Rhys Davids, 1917: 156-9) and Lalitavistara XXIV.l.378-9 (translated Foucaux, 1884: 315), and see Lamotte, 1944-80: 11, 880 (fn. 1).
On Peshawar 2042 Mara appears to attack on the Bodhisattva's right and is attended by a different person on each side. On Berlin MIK I 10198 (Berlin, 1984: 70-1, no. 34) assailants appear on both sides and Indra in cylindrical cap and a figure in a lion's skin headdress seem to belong to the demonic army.

The haloed Bodhisattva is seated on the bed, his hair in a chignon tied at its base and one leg pendent; he raises his right hand while his groom approaches carrying a turban. He wears a paridhāna and the uttarīya leaves the chest almost bare, except for a necklace with one pendant and a collar with pendants of various shapes. His wife is asleep on the bed with one hand under her head on the pillow, the arm grasped by the other hand; she is bare to the waist and wears multiple bracelets, a necklace, long earrings, a wreath of floral pattern and, under her lower garment, anklets.
At the right a female guard with spear, eyes closed in sleep, wears a long-sleeved tunic, a necklace and a semi-circular ornament above her forehead. Below, head buried in her arms which she supports on a banded barrel drum, a sleeping attendant with anklets, a long-sleeved tunic with a beaded strip down the side and over it a girdle with ornamental plates securing her paridhāna, part of which is drawn up between her legs into the girdle at the back, sits on a low circular cushion; she wears a densely segmented wreath headdress and a large loop of hair at the back of the head. Another attendant squats frontally, wreathed head supported on her arms and resting between her elbows on her knees. Her legs, spread wide under her garment, have large anklets. Another attendant, dressed like the first with a segmented wreath headdress but a very long braid and anklets, sits with her back to the viewer and supports herself on a large and flat cushion. The groom Chandaka, with a moustache, leans forward behind the couch and deferentially presents a crested turban with bands and the piriform frontal ornament, himself wearing a crested turban, uttarīya, paridhāna, necklace, earring and armlet in three lobes.
The couch consists of a mattress, pillows with a raised band on the side and a patterned textile with bands of open flowers, scrolling, crossed and hatched zones hanging between the hidden legs. A slender pillar behind supports an oil-lamp and across the back hangs a curtain.
The prominent double-framed flanking columns have a Corinthian capital in distinct upper and lower parts, while the base mouldings, unusually, are of Attic type with a scotia.

Although this piece was conceived in a larger and less populated frame and carved with far less precision and delicacy than BM 1900.0414.12, the treatment of the sharply outlined, open eyes of the male figures, the closed eyes of the women, the shape of the heads and the flat execution of the faces are very similar.
The Bodhisattva's revulsion in the women's quarters before the Renunciation occurs in the more developed sources which describe the repellent dishevelled postures of the sleeping women musicians, the Bodhisattva's sense of a burial or cremation ground and his summoning Chandaka and Kaṇṭhaka. A similar tradition is in the Jātaka Introduction where 'the mother of Rāhula' and the child are in the next room.
The scenes of the Great Renunciation among the Women usually show the haloed Bodhisattva seated on a couch and turned to his right while a woman, presumably his wife, lies sleeping on it, head to the right, as women musicians sprawl below with their instruments. Chandaka enters from the left with the turban as here or with both horse and turban. The Bodhisattva is usually with his hair in a chignon, but on Peshawar 1718 he is standing and wears a turban in front of Chandaka and Kaṇṭhaka.

(Object),,,"Part of a panel showing the hand of the Bodhisattva laying grass on the seat of Enlightenment (bodhimaṇḍa) beneath the bodhi tree. On the right the hand of the lost standing Bodhisattva lays a long bundle of grass on the plain flat top of the bodhimaṇḍa. Behind it a figure rises almost in profile wearing uttarīya and with hair drawn back into a chignon secured with a fillet and a leaning tree trunk has branches with clearly pointed pipal leaves. Also beside the tree and standing frontally behind the seat another, slightly curving figure with similar hairstyle, collar, bracelets and uttarīya in the narrow mode raises his right hand as if in abhaya and with his left holds by the bottom of its scabbard a sword, the baldrick passing through the vertical suspension bridge and wound round the middle.
Left of the bodhimaṇḍa stand a male and female: the male is turbaned with a high crest to one side and wears a collar and necklace, earrings, armlets and bracelets, the uttarīya perhaps knotted and falling from the middle and in front of the paridhāna; the female stands with her left ankle over the right, wearing a wreath headdress with a loop of hair above, a beaded earring, necklace, a tunic and a long overgarment draped from her left arm, bracelets and anklets. Her stance emphasises the right hip on which she rests her hand while she leans with the other arm on the right shoulder of the male figure, throwing her head back; the drape over her right arm also emphasises the projecting hip and her necklace rounds one of her breasts. The male seems slightly to turn his head towards her as though distracted from his concern with the central event of the scene, and his mannered stance is emphasised by one hand on his necklace and the other on his hip. Above them are three haloed half-length figures turned towards the tree, all wearing uttarīya and chignon. Two have hands joined before them.
The rectangular bodhimaṇḍa, with its prominent top, has sawtooth enrichment, panels with blown flowers, and a high moulded plinth; the sides, apart from mouldings top and bottom, are smoothly worked and plain. The form of seat, ornamented or plain and with the kuśa grass of meditation frequently strewn on it, seems the Buddha's most usual seat on the reliefs; flanking monks so seated are presumably arhats.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Buner;  Found/Acquired: Swat Valley,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 7.40 centimetres; Height: 27 centimetres; Width: 26 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The accidental disposition of the break creates a dramatic contrast between the simplicity of the hand laying down the grass and the opulent softness, despite abrasion, in the modelling of the languorous-looking couple beside the bodhimaṇḍa; the broad, rounded planes of the male torso and the full, curved volumes of his face are of a piece with the woman's stance. Regardless of their identity, this contrast, highlighting renunciation, was perhaps not wholly accidental.
After receiving the homage of Kālika and Suvarṇaprabhāsā and considering the need to provide a grass seat for his Enlightenment as previous Buddhas had done, the Bodhisattva saw a grass-cutter called Svastika and asked him for grass; having spread the handful Svastika had given him at the foot of the bodhi tree, the Bodhisattva sat down upon it. In the Pāli tradition of the Jātaka Introduction the grass-cutter, called Sotthiya, gave eight bundles of grass and the Bodhisattva, after considering the cardinal points and facing the east, scattered the grass and a seat at once arose.
Foucher,  1905-51: I, 395ff, sees in the worshipping and emerging figure of Lahore 384 (ibid.: 1, fig. 199) a tree-spirit and refers us to four male or eight female spirits (devatās) of the bodhi tree in the Lalitavistara; the four almost identical male figures, three haloed, on this panel may be such a set; the figure with sword may then be an attendant on Māra (if not Māra himself according to Majumdar), who, with one of his daughters, already stands beside the maṇḍa preparing for the Temptation [see Foucher, 1905-51: II, I95-7 withdrawing his suggestion (ibid.: I, 396) that the couple is the nāga Kālika with consort]. For Māra beside the bodhi tree on the middle architrave on the North Gateway of Sāncī I see Marshall and Foucher, 1940: II, pl. XXIX. 
For a close parallel for the two figures beside the bodhimaṇḍa compare the bottom scene of a false gable slab where the tall Bodhisattva is accompanied by Vajrapāṇi only and a celestial throwing flowers; Majumdar considers the worshipper rising from the strewn seat of this relief to be the grass-cutter Svastika and the figure holding the sword in the same way as here, Māra. The bodhimaṇḍa has the same floral ornament and the grass is laid down on a top already strewn. For variants of this scene but all with the Bodhisattva laying down grass see Calcutta G. 18/A23272 (Majumdar, 1937; 45, no. 46 and pl. VIIIb) which shows worshippers as well as the couple beside the maṇḍa and a figure with girt sword on the right beside the Bodhisattva; Lahore 384 which has Vajrapāṇi, a worshipper rising from the seat and the couple; the fragmentary Chandigarh 87 (Foucher, 1905-51: 1, fig. 200) on which only a worshipper rises from the seat and the couple is lacking; Berlin MIK 1 204 which has Vajrapāṇi, a worshipping male and a woman who may hold a mirror. What appear to be variants without the laying-down of the grass include Peshawar 1884 (Kurita, 1988-90: 1, fig. 220) where a powerfully built and portly figure rises from the seat or behind it, holding a wand, while a small figure in the foliage, evidently the tree-spirit, kneels and joins his hands and the tall Bodhisattva may be in abhaya; and an unnumbered piece exhibited beside it (Sehrai, 1978: fig. 29) where an indistinct figure kneels at a corner of the seat; in both cases a couple much as here flanks it and the trees are both clearly pipal. Bombay 11, with a seated Bodhisattva in abhaya and a distinct maka-radhvaja, is an unusual iconography and, assuming the same subject, in contrast to Bombay 10 where there seems to be a hand laying down grass (Chandra, 1974: 11-12, pis 25-6). On Calcutta G. 18/A23272, Peshawar 787 and Chandigarh 87 the earth-goddess (Foucher, 1905-51: 1, 398-9) emerges as a half-length figure out of acanthus on the face of the bodhimaṇḍa.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, chipped and worn.

The distribution of the relics falls into a shorter cycle within the Death cycle and presupposes them to have been claimed with threats of hostilities by eight parties who agreed to submit themselves to the arbitration of a brāhmaṇa. He is usually behind a table, which can be small or large, standing in the middle or to one side, the latter usually when the table is small and few claimants are shown, but he can be central with a small table and few claimants or central with a large table and a row of claimants flanking him. The claimants sometimes hold reliquaries, while on the table may be relics made into balls (according to Foucher their size is one droṇa) or caskets, as above. They can number the full eight or fewer; the balls are often cross-hatched or suggest grape bunches or blackberries. In this form they may represent the clay balls into which Hindu remains are still embedded for the asthikṣepa ceremony, but an enveloping mesh or floral garland seems also possible. The presence of guards is common to other scenes of the Distribution and may reflect the threat of hostilities over the relics.; Zwalf 1985

Below the waist he is covered with very summary indications of a garment, but the soles seem bare. His head, unevenly sliced at right angles to the slab, is bearded on one side along the jaw to the chin and still has one deep-set eye, a prominent cheek-bone and horizontal mouth below a moustache.

During these practices gods reported his imminent death to the Bodhisattva's mother in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, but when she came she was consoled that he would attain nirvāṇa; she left him to continue his practices but his father sent daily messengers to learn of his son's condition and the gods watched day and night and worshipped him.

The gods offered to feed him through the pores of his hair but he refused and preferred either to prepare his own food, supplemented with milk-rice from Sujātā, a village headman's daughter, or to take it from her entirely. The Pāli tradition is, in canonical accounts, substantially similar as to the ascetic practices, but the story of Sujātā and her food offering to the Bodhisattva as he sat under a 'nyagrodha' is in the commentatorial literature and refers to the eve of the Enlightenment when the Bodhisattva had already begged food, broken his fast and resumed his former appearance.
Apparently evolved in and at first confined to Gandhāra, figures of the fasting Bodhisattva, whether large, as at Lahore and Peshawar, or that from Shotorak and smaller pieces, may have been meditational images besides serving narrative purposes, perhaps with separate flanking figures. Relief panels with flanking figures are not especially numerous and also differ among themselves too much to provide dependable explanations for this piece. Examples with female assistants are inconclusive and male assistants range from donors to deities.
For quite exceptional sequences of very unusual aspect see Berlin MIK 1 79,14 where, from right to left, the emaciated Bodhisattva is flanked by Brahmā and Indra and crosses the Nairañjanā and, quite restored, receives bowls from flanking females; and a strip, in a private Japanese collection, where the skeletal Bodhisattva is flanked by tormenting village children, then by women offering a bowl and water pot respectively and, finally, in his normal appearance, receives a bundle of grass.
While it seems certain that the Bodhisattva is here attended by Vajrapāṇi and Indra, the flanking and formally paired male and female worshippers seem like donors and may be intentionally ambiguous. Foucher prefers to see in the outer male worshipper Brahmā with a collar (see BM 1917.0501.1) beside Indra, while the corresponding female, if not Māyā come from the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, then Sujātā offering food.
For a Western affinity for the fasting Bodhisattva seen by Rowland in the brutal realism of the Hellenistic art of Alexandria, compare Lamb, 1929: pl. LXXVIIa.; Zwalf 1985
Disappointed by spiritual masters, the Bodhisattva took to severe fasting and was even reported dead. When fasts failed to reveal the truth, he turned to the middle way between worldliness and mortification, one definition of the Buddhist path to salvation. He accepted a rice-brew from a village headman's daughter, who had come to offer it to a nature spirit in thanksgiving for the birth of a son. She stands beside the emaciated Bodhisattva with his frequent companions, the gods Indra and Brahmā, and his protector Vajrapāṇi.",Zwalf 1985 / Buddhism: Art and Faith; Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:

The garland running around the stupa may be seen as an offering with fertility imagery where the amorino is appropriately a yakṣa. The earlier garlanding of domes is illustrated at Bharhut and Sanci, where, as perhaps at Chatpat and Taxila, it was supported by pegs (compare BM 1892.1103.78, BM 1959.0717.1, BM 1949.0718.48 and BM 1904.1217.32).
The stone garland frieze, frequent on single narrow panels, both flat and curved, is not often found on the same slab as other horizontal registers. It occurs under a false gable arch, on stupa domes, on solid drums, on a fragment showing a double-domed roof, on a rectangular stupa platform, as an integral register below a preaching Buddha panel and below a row of Buddhas. The motif is found on stair-risers (BM 1880.883 and BM 1880.59) and on a panel reused beside the porch of a shrine at Butkara III.
The classical affinities of the continuous garland are referred generally to the eastern Mediterranean and a 2nd-century introduction. Combaz, with comparisons, proposes the garland frieze in Gandhāra as a classicising expression of a vegetal motif already present in the Indian tradition. The diffusion of the garland from Gandhāra may be seen at Kuṣāṇa Mathurā and, in the fifth century, in Kashmir.
For reliefs showing garlands on stupa domes, without amorini and perhaps to be thought of as hanging from pegs like BM 1892.1103.78, BM 1959.0717.1 and BM 1949.0718.48; see also BM 1902.1002.29 (with open flowers in the dips as at Butkara I).

They have moustaches and short projecting beards, finely grooved linear hair parted in the middle with V-shaped locks above the forehead and longer locks behind, pointed ears where they clear the hair; the eyes are open and ringed with narrow lids, the faces long and modelled to show cheekbones, sharp noses and lips. The chests are broad beneath ridges for collar-bones, except on one figure, and on all but that figure musculature is clumsily modelled below the breast as small mounds in two rows of four.

The haloed Bodhisattva wears an uttarīya over both shoulders; one end passes under his right arm while the other lies over the left elbow, leaving the chest bare. A pleated end of the paridhāna falls onto the rectangular seat between the knees. On the turban bands meet at a large central bead beneath a fantail crest with pointed conical ornament and a summarily executed vertical loop of cloth with an end below projects at both sides. The Bodhisattva wears a collar and necklace, both plain, earrings and bracelets. His head is oval and regular, the face slightly fleshy with protruding rounded eyes, the edges above them for eyebrows and the curved mouth sharp. The torso is broad and spreading with raised breasts beside the necklace and a globular navel. Above him branches with large, more or less paired leaves curve upwards.
On the Bodhisattva's left a turbaned kneeling figure wears uttarīya and paridhāna and joins his hands as if to leave a space between them. He may be Indra. His turban and ornaments are like those of the Bodhisattva. Opposite a figure kneels similarly and in similar dress, but with collar only and long hair beneath a horizontal length of hair, knotted in the middle and looped at one end; the joined hands are damaged. The face, with protruding rounded eyes like those on the other figures, is fuller and fleshier and if the figure is Brahmā the collar is exceptional.
Behind both flanking figures and along the edge of the panel are tree trunks in very low relief ending in branches like those above the central figure but straighter.

If the presence of Brahmā, notwithstanding the rare collar, is admitted together with that of Indra, this scene may illustrate the Instigation (saṃcodana) in which these and other gods urge the Bodhisattva to renounce the world (see also BM 1890.1116.1). Commenting on the rather loose iconography for this subject, Foucher, 1905-51: 11, 222, refers to instances showing a turbaned and meditating figure under branches which he explains as contamination from outdoor scenes. If instead this scene illustrates the Bodhisattva Śvetaketu in the Tuṣita heaven considering his last birth as Siddhārtha, it has some agreements with the well-known relief from Sikri ascribed to this theme, and there is literary support for the presence of Brahmā and Indra. Lobo, proposing another iconograhy for the Tuṣita scenes, has identified the Sikri panel as showing the Bodhisatva's meditations before the earthly Instigation, and in another, where a turbaned Bodhisattva in dhyāna is shown as here together with Brahmā and Indra, she believes the meditations are combined with the Instigation itself.

From right to left, in the first scene, the haloed and damaged Dīpaṃkara is in abhaya and three-quarter view. The standing Megha raises his damaged right hand holding flowers, his left holds a broken water pot at his waist; he wears an ascetic's tunic with bared right shoulder and his hair is gathered into a chignon. Megha reappears below in a curved posture on hands and knees, hair perhaps extending below Dlpamkara's feet. An oblique doorway behind, with moulded sloping jambs, a rectangular threshold and an indistinct lintel, frame Prakṛti who holds a pot at her waist. Behind Dīpaṃkara a burly Vajrapāṇi with tightly curled hair holds his vajra along the line of his narrow plunging uttarīya, which just reveals the genitals. Behind him are two monks in rhythmically curved stance, their right arms in the robe across the chest and the left hanging down with a curved gathering of drapery to the bottom of the garment.
In the next scene, in the centre, a turbaned and haloed figure with uttarīya and paridhāna, and showing a muscular chest and arm, stands with one arm down, the other on the hip, wearing the usual ornaments. Beside him his queen is seated on a long draped seat, her raised right hand holding a lotus; she wears a wreath headdress with protruding loop of hair and ornaments. The kneeling figure on each side appears to be female, with anklets and girdles, and hands joined. Behind and beside each suppliant a pair of similar standing females join hands and hold flowers.

(Object),,,"Panel showing the Bodhisattva as King Śibi ransoming a pigeon with his own flesh. From right to left a youthful haloed deity with moustache and a chignon bound at the base stands almost in profile with his right hand raised, palm outward. He wears a paridhāna and uttarīya, a collar with small pendants and double bracelets, that on his left wrist beaded and with discs. Beside him Indra, slightly turned towards the king, raises his right hand at right angles to himself, the thumb across the palm, a flat vajra in the left hand and wearing paridhāna and uttarīya in the narrow mode. He is crowned with his cylindrical cap, its side cross-hatched and with mouldings above, which rests on a wreath or a rounded ornamental brim, and wears one wide flat bracelet and another like that of the deity beside him, a collar and a necklace. Between him and the group around Śibi an almost frontal figure, turned slightly towards the king and with a small double-looped chignon on a bowl crop hairstyle, earrings, moustache, paridhāna and uttarīya, holds a weighing device of steelyard type consisting of a suspended bar also supported by a damaged hand. At one end what must be the king's flesh is heaped in a suspended bag, its weight measured along the other, longer side of the bar. Above is a damaged projection discussed below.
At the left the drooping king is seated on a throne, supporting himself over one side at the right armpit while with his other arm he clasps the woman in front of him, his hand on her back. The footstool, adorned with three open flowers, emphasises a large foot and the bared leg, thrust forward, from which a kneeling figure with moustache, paridhāna, uttarīya and earrings, cuts with a knife. The king has a moustache, wears a crested turban, a collar with large circular pendants and a necklace, armlets, bracelets, earrings, paridhāna and uttarīya. The woman in front of him, with wreath headdress and necklace, long-sleeved garment, a scarf or long garment draped over her left shoulder and braid on the back, leans forward, stretching out her left hand to the king's side. Above the king is a parasol decorated with a trellised motif; the throne, with back and sides, has a textile draped over the side beneath the king's arm, a floral panel and an elaborate turned leg beside which stands the pigeon.
On all the figures drapery folds are shown by dense grooves and ridges, heads are well shaped, round to oval and the features clear-cut with open eyes and distinct upper lids. The torsos are generally smooth with gentle modelling, nipples and gashed navels on the males. The heavy lids give a certain uniformity of appearance and this suggests a sad and solemn participation of all the protagonists. The king's forehead is puckered in pain and the angle of his head, like that of the other actors, and the forward posture of the woman, whose supporting arm is undercut, emphasise the pathos of the event. The composition balances the group of tall deities observing, Indra now in his true form at the climax of the sacrifice, the central figure of the weigher in a gentle compassionate dehanchement, holding the suspended flesh in emphatic relief, and the heads of the king, the woman and the wiclder of the knife aligned in a triangular scheme.
The broken projection above the figure with the steelyard must be the hawk or falcon; we appear to have continuous narration, with Indra and his earlier form as bird and correspondingly the youthful figure on the right may be the divine Viśvakarmā along with his form as the pigeon.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,Diameter: 5.50 centimetres; Height: 23.30 centimetres; Width: 32.40 centimetres,,"Zwalf 1996:
The theme, to be distinguished from Śibi's gift of his eyes (also commemorated on one of the 'four great stupas'), occurs, with variants, in different texts and tells how Indra tested the resolve of the Bodhisattva in his birth as King Śibi. Śibi, who had vowed to protect all creatures, ransomed a pigeon pursued by Indra disguised as a falcon, eagle, or sparrow-hawk, while the pigeon was really the god Viśvakarmā acting at Indra's behest. Śibi offered in his own flesh the equivalent of the pigeon's weight; parts of his body were successively cut off and heaped into a scale, but the pigeon proved still too heavy until the king, with what was left of himself, got into it. In this extremity he reaffirmed his joy at fulfilling the Bodhisattva vow and prayed, in token of his sincerity, to become whole again; and this then came about. The two gods resumed their own forms.
The execution recalls the so-called Buner group; the drapery the 'drawing' manner of Butkara I; Viśvakarmā/Brahmā's necklace that of a spectator on Peshawar 2071 (Ingholt, 1957: fig. 16); and compare Fabregues.

From Whitfield 1985:
This seated figure, entirely flat at the back, was made in a mould as an appliqué piece. It was one of the Buddha figures in the nimbus of a colossal standing figure of the Buddha, of which only the lower legs and drapery were still extant when Stein examined and photographed the site (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XIVb). The oval head, which has lost the facial features, echoes the treatment seen in the large head (Pl. 63). The regular drapery folds are for the most part simple incised lines, hugging the form beneath and following the general conventions of Gandharan sculpture. Due to early consolidation work, the surface of the figure has acquired a shine which differs from the matt appearance of the original red clay wash.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此佛坐像的背面完全是平的，是用模子製作的化佛。化佛是安裝在巨大佛立像的頭光上的，當斯坦因考查此遺迹進行拍照時，那巨像的腳尖和衣紋還殘留著（參照《古代和田》圖版XIV.b）。頭部爲橢圓形，面部已經破損，其色彩大概與圖63的佛頭相同。另外，衣紋線基本是用簡單而有規則的刻線表現，衣服下的線條很有肉感，大概融合了犍陀羅雕刻的流派。由於早期的固化作用，像的表面出現一層光澤，這與紅粘土製品表面沒有光澤是不同的。","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts",Not on display,,,buddha; 佛 (Chinese),Representation of: Buddha;  Representation of: 佛陀,,,,,,,,1907,"The 1907-11-11 group refers to objects from Stein's First Central Asian  Expedition, 1900-01.

From Whitfield 1985:
Miniature plaques such as these were produced in quantity by the use of moulds, and applied to form parts of the nimbus decoration of larger statues. In the case of many of the Rawak figures, this decoration was quite elaborate (see Gropp, 1974, Fig. 110, p. 233), and they appear around the edges of the aureoles of standing figures as well as in the nimbus (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XVIIIc). As Stein himself wrote:
Special artistic interest attaches to the remains of the elaborate aureoles which ... encircled these statues. They varied but little in details. Every-where there was a border formed by a cloud-scroll, and within it a broad band showing small plaques of seated Buddhas or Bodhisattvas inserted between wreaths of a very graceful bead-ornament.

From Whitfield 1985:
Miniature plaques such as these were produced in quantity by the use of moulds, and applied to form parts of the nimbus decoration of larger statues. In the case of many of the Rawak figures, this decoration was quite elaborate (see Gropp, 1974, Fig. 110, p. 233), and they appear around the edges of the aureoles of standing figures as well as in the nimbus (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XVIIIc). As Stein himself wrote:
Special artistic interest attaches to the remains of the elaborate aureoles which ... encircled these statues. They varied but little in details. Every-where there was a border formed by a cloud-scroll, and within it a broad band showing small plaques of seated Buddhas or Bodhisattvas inserted between wreaths of a very graceful bead-ornament. The latter were gathered at intervals into bunches surmounted y a fleur-de-lis. A second band of small seated Buddhas seems to have filled the space left between the highly ornamental border and the edges of the drapery. (Ibid., Vol. I, p.499)

Amongst the most remarkable of all services made during this period is the well-known pearlware 'Water Lily' service ordered in 1807 and delivered in 1808 to Dr Robert Darwin, son of Dr Erasmus Darwin and father of the evolutionist Charles Darwin. This plate is from the service and was given to A. W. Franks by Dr Joseph Hooker (1817-1911), Director of Kew Gardens between 1865 and 1885 and friend of Charles Darwin. The 'Water Lily' pattern almost certainly represents the earliest use of brown underglaze printing in Staffordshire that can be accurately dated. The decision to introduce the manufacture of underglaze printed ware at Etruria (overglaze printing having been used since the 1770s) was taken on 31 March 1805. The 'Water Lily' pattern was the first to be used at Etruria that reproduced identifiable botanical prints. The engravings of the water lilies, all members of the 'Nymphaeaceae' family, indigenous to watery places, have been identified as: 'nymphaea stellata', or starry water lily, on the left; 'nymphaea lotus', or Lotus of Egypt, on the right; and 'nelumbium speciosum', or sacred Lotus of Buddha, the fully opened flower in the centre, with large, veined indented leaves. The lilies were all copied either from the 'Botanist's Repository' or from the 'Botanical Magazine', periodicals published, between October 1803 and February 1806.

The great Buddhist stūpa at Amarāvatī was one of the most important centres of Buddhism in southern India from the early centuries of the present era until its complete abandonment some time after the fourteenth century. This pre-eminence was initially based on the economic power of the Sātavāhana kings who are closely associated with the city of Dharaṇīkoṭa, close to the stūpa. During the Sātavāhana period, the city no doubt provided a ready source of patronage, a situation only changed by the rise of the Ikṣvāku dynasty based at Nāgārjunakoṇḍa further up the river Krishna.
In the manner of early Buddhist stūpa, the whole structure was surrounded by a railing fence of which the present example is a part. The railing, vedikā, was made up of upright elements (such as this) and cross-bars which connected these standing, horizontal parts. The outer faces of the uprights were decorated with lotus blossoms and small figural scenes -including those showing gaṇas playing music and dancing. The inner face, as seen here, was the face which would have been seen by devotees performing pradakṣiṇā; this was conceived rather differently. Here scenes from the life of the Buddha and from the jātakas were shown, as moral precepts to be 'read' by those who processed around the stūpa.
Of great interest in the roundel is the symbolic indication of the presence of the holy child, by footprints on the cloth held by the old man in the centre of the roundel. There is no bodily image shown. This relief belongs to that earlier period at Amaravati when the bodily form is still only shown symbolically; during the next century this was to change with profound consequences not only in the Indian subcontinent, but throughout Southeast Asia and the Far East.","Tripe 1859 / Photographs of the Elliot Marbles and other subjects in the Central Museum, Madras; Fergusson 1873 / Tree and Serpent Worship; Barrett 1954 / Sculptures from Amaravati in the British Museum; Morley 1985 / Indian Sculpture; Knox 1992 / Amaravati: Buddhist sculpture from the Great Stupa; Blurton 1997 / The Enduring Image: Treasures from the British Museum",Not on display,"Exhibited:

The casket tapers slightly towards the rim and lacks a lid. The arcading round the side consists of eight pointed caitya-arches resting on pilasters. Each arch has a plain recessed face and the pilaster capitals consist of a plain fillet above a torus and a fillet. The pilaster shafts have each a recessed oblong panel with an outlined border curved at the top and the base mouldings repeat those of the capitals in a contrary sequence. The compartments form two groups (A and B) of three at opposite sides to each other, each group having an almost identical central Buddha flanked by closely similar, worshipping deities in profile, and the three are separated at both ends by a single similar compartment containing the same frontal worshipping figure.
The Buddha stands frontally in slight 'dehanchement', but his left leg is flexed and its foot raised, while his right leg points sideways as if he is walking. His right hand is raised, palm outwards, to the centre of his breast in a less usual, perhaps archaic abhayamudra, while the left hand rests somewhat indistinguishably at the hip, not very clearly holding the robe which seems also to be wrapped round the wrist and falling from it; a length of the robe also appears to hang from the right arm. The neckline on Buddha A is coherently in relief, while on Buddha B it is more diffused and linear; Buddha A is generally more finely executed, a thinner and taller figure with a long oval face and a more pronounced peak of the undulating hair where the face of the other is rounder, more youthful and with a less clear moustache. On both the robe hangs with some effect of wet drapery. Both Buddhas are haloed, but on Buddha A the halo has a raised border and the uṣṇīṣa is much larger and, with the open eyes and moustache, recalls an early Buddha type in stone.
On each Buddha's left stands a haloed turbaned figure of Indra in profile, his head somewhat inclined, the left leg flexed a little backwards, the left arm, with a bracelet and armlet, raised and hand(s) joined. He wears a paridhāna, and unusually the uttarīya hangs front and back over his right shoulder and loops round the left waist; on figure A a short length also hangs over the left shoulder. Other differences are in the position and relief of the lower left leg and in the more abundant drapery of the uttarīya on figure B.
On each Buddha's right a haloed and bearded figure of Brahmā, with a large chignon and a water pot held in his left hand, walks towards the Buddha and raises his right hand no higher than the Buddha's; it is seen from the back with the fingers curved forwards. He wears a paridhāna, and the uttarīya over his left shoulder, with a long fluttering fall at his back, appears on the left arm and loops in the narrow mode round the right of the body. Differences between the two are the finer tooling and relief of the taller and erect figure of group A, while that of B seems more squat and has a more bowed posture; both make a distinctly classicising impression.
The haloed dividing figure is youthful and stands frontally, his flexed left leg and his right foot recalling the Buddha's stance; his hands are brought together before his breast and he wears a paridhāna and uttarīya with two long ends falling on each side; the uttarīya crosses the body in the narrow mode from the left shoulder where it also forms a horizontal semiloop. Both arms wear an armlet and bracelets. The hair is in a chignon drawn in at its base; below it falls from a parting to form pronounced 'bouffant' locks at the sides, especially on the figure behind the Indra of group B, whose expression is much more of a beatific smile. Like that of Buddha A, his halo shows a raised border. Figure A, standing behind Indra A, also appears taller and in greater and clearer relief and his expression seems more austere. Huntington holds these figures to be a Bodhisattva (1985, p.115), while Cribb has discussed them as perhaps Maitreya (1985, pp.82-3).~Above and below the arcade is a row of garnets in gypsy settings separated by a motif of four petals or lobes, some more like pairs of linked heart shapes. In the spandrels are distinct and well-articulated eagles soaring with outspread wings and heads turned to each other to form pairs, their feathers carefully indicated by shallow grooves and punched dots. At the bottom of the casket are mouldings as of a pillar base with a plinth and a rather small torus under a large cavetto. On the underside is a blown lotus of eight double-outlined and centrally grooved petals narrowing towards the gynoecium, which is punched with large dots; between the petals and the border is a field densely punched with smaller dots, and between the points of the petals are small, standing, opening lotuses in the fashion seen on 1899,0609.39 (Zwalf 1996).",,,,,,,Buddhist,1stC (circa),Made in: Darunta,Excavated/Findspot: Bimaran Stupa 2,gold; garnet; pitch,,,repoussé; inlaid,Diameter: 6.60 centimetres at base ; Diameter: 6 centimetres at rim ; Height: 6.50 centimetres,,"This reliquary was found inside the inscribed steatite reliquary 1880.27.

Errington: Masson's manuscript record shows that the reliquary was found without a lid at the time of excavation (Uncat. MSS Bundle 1b, f.1; MSS Eur. E161/VII, f.68).

The relic deposit also contained four posthumously issued coins in the name of Azes which according to research done in 2012-13 are now dated c. late 1st century (IOC 201-IOC.204).; Zwalf 1985: This famous object was found in a 'stūpa' inside an inscribed stone box, now also in the British Museum. Framed by arcades formed with the Indian pointed arch are the Buddha and the gods Indra and Brahmā shown twice and separated by a worshipper whose head-dress, ear-rings and armlets suggest a Bodhisattva. Between the arches are eagles and, above and below, garnets. The inscription refers to relics of the Buddha dedicated by one Śivarakṣita; if the coins found nearby were contemporary, the reliquary would be of the 1st century AD and its Buddha image perhaps earlier than Kaniṣka I's reign. The resemblance of the Buddhas on this casket and Kaniṣka I's gold coin (no.121) appears close.","Masson Uncat. MSS; Masson MSS Eur. E161/VII; Wilson 1841 / Ariana Antiqua.

This model of a characteristic Gandharan 'stūpa' lacks stairs leading to the processional platform. The latticed railing commonly enclosed central Indian 'stūpas' but is almost never reported from Gandhara. On one side of the railing is an image of a meditating Buddha.; Zwalf 1996:
In Gandhāra the vedikā of structural stupas has hardly survived in situ. Stupas with a vedikā pierced by a gateway and with a stair are found among the petroglyphs at Chilas II.
According to a manuscript note by Major Pearse found at the Museum inside BM 1887.0717.30 and now in the archive of the Department of Oriental Antiquities, this model was 'procured in March 1851 from a topie or mound at the village of Jowalean on the Hurroo River in the District of Huzaree, Punjab'. Cunningham, 1871: 147, attributes this model to stupa C opened by Major Pearse in March 1851 and supposes it still to have carried some of its original gilding to account for recollections reported to him of a golden figure.

[4] eṣa vihara acaryaṇa mahasaṃghigaṇa parigraha Inscription translation: Baums 2012: [1] In the 51st year, in the month Artemisios, after 15 (days), at this time Vag̱amareg̱a, son of Kamagulya – he has made his abode here in Khavada – establishes in the Vag̱amareg̱a monastery in a stūpa a relic of the Lord, the Śākya sage. Inscription note: The inscription around the shoulder and the middle with four lines of punched Kharoshthi characters is dated to the year 51 of the first Kushan era and in the reign of Huvishka (2nd century AD). The characters are now picked out in white and are of smaller size along the shoulder than those in the shorter line below it. The inscription is of the Mahāsāṃghika sect and dedicates a relic of the Buddha in a stupa at Khavada, thought to correspond to modern Wardak, Wardak district, about 65 km south-west of Kabul.","E. Errington: Masson records that the relic deposit comprised 'a copper vessel with dotted Pehlevi [sic] inscription', which contained 'sundry relics' and '66 copper coins' (Masson MSS Eur. E161/VII, f. 27). The coins are identifiable from Masson's description of 'Indo-Scythic' coins and account of the finds in Wilson 1841, p.118 as Kushan coins of Wima Kadphises, Kanishka I and Huvishka, i.e. a similar combination of the same types as the 21 coins from Chahar Bagh Stupa 4 (see CM 1979,0215.21-41). 
The reliquary and associated finds were excavated in 1836 (MSS Eur. E161/VII, f.27).They were dispatched from Kabul by Masson in October 1836, but only reached London in March 1839, too late for more than a brief note in Wilson 1841.","Masson MSS Eur.

On the lower wall of the body is a partly damaged band of three grooves which fail to join up exactly; between it and a single such groove just below the rim is a line of Kharoṣṭhī characters. On the lid, from the rim upwards, is a band of three grooves, a band resembling a bead-and-reel ornament in low relief, the beads pierced or grooved horizontally, and above them a broad cross-hatched band. The shoulder of the lid carries a broad plain fillet and two thin convex mouldings and on the top is a slightly convex band with a line of Kharoṣṭhī; a broad fillet rings the foot of a small hollow bowl surmounting the lid to form a second smaller compartment. This has an inner flange at the rim to accommodate another lid as on 1880.98, which was already missing when the relic deposit was first uncovered. The lid and body of the casket are flanged to fit as on 1880.99. The body must originally have been compartmented as in 1880.98, for traces survive on the inner wall of four rough projections aligned as if to meet in the middle.

C. Fabrègues: The motif of the column surmounted by a lion recalls the pillars bearing the edicts of the Mauryan king Ashoka (c. 269–232 BC) which were erected all over India at sites such as Lauriya-Nandangarh (Thapar 1997, pp.5-6). Pillars similarly mounted with seated lions were also erected beside stupas at Buddhist sites such as Saidu Sharif I in Swat, dated 1st–5th century (Faccenna and Callieri 2003, pp.311, 314, fig.21), the lion being a symbol of the Budda, lion of the Shakya clan (Rowland 1953, pl.8). The women on the ring may be interpreted as worshipping the Buddha through circumambulation of the pillar, as is depicted on a sandstone relief from Mathura in the Lucknow Museum attributable to the 1st century AD (Lucknow State Museum, J.268: Klimburg-Salter 1995, fig.95a).

The Bodhisattva, born as the ever-charitable Viśvaṃtara, gave away to brāhmaṇas the auspicious white elephant on which he rode and was on this account banished with his wife Madrī and their two children. On the road he gave away his chariot and horses and the parents continued on foot, each carrying a child, to a hermitage; there, in Madrī's absence, he gave away his children to be servants of a brāhmaṇa. When Madrī returned she was given to Indra, disguised as a brāhmaṇa, for the Bodhisattva's final test. The god then resumed his shape, restored Madrī and, by his intervention, the children were redeemed from the brāhmaṇa by their grandfather. In the much longer Pāli account the protagonists have almost the same names, and despite many differences of detail the sequence of events is the same.

In the Pali tradition of jātaka 485 the armed king of Benares comes upon a kiṃnara couple playing and dancing beside a stream; enamoured of the kiṃnarī, the king shoots the kiṃnara, who is the Bodhisattva, but his consort refuses the king and calls upon the gods. Indra, moved by her fidelity and disguised as a brāhmaṇa, sprinkles the Bodhisattva with water and restores him to life.
The identification of this theme in Gandhāra is due to Foucher following Vogel; a Sanskrit story of the faithful kiṃnarī lacks the playing and dancing and in it the widowed sprite shares her consort's funeral pyre. Whatever the subject, on the only other comparable piece reported the archer is on foot and aims at a couple also with a male harpist; the next scene shows the male musician lying dead while the archer in two successive incidents is perhaps trying to take a grieving woman away. The scene at Bhārhut captioned 'Kinara jātaka' lacks any sufficient feature in common with the Gandhāra pieces and Luiders, 1963: I36ff., refers it to another story.

In the Mahāvastu account the Bodhisattva became incarnated as Śyāma(ka), to serve, as their only son, a frail and blind pair of ascetics. While fetching them water he fell victim to the arrow of a king hunting a deer and, as he died, entrusted his parents to the penitent king's care. Amid the lamentations of animal creation the king brought the old couple water and the tidings of their son's death and led them back to where he lay. As his mother cradled his head, his father invoked his son's merits and by that incantation restored him to life. For the role of Indra in this connection see 1880-55. The Pāli tradition has a somewhat different frame-story in which the king, when hunting, deliberately shot Sāma ( = Śyāma), because he realised that he was an exceptional being and wished to prevent his escape until he had learned who he was. The story ends in the same way but both parents caress their dead child, both invoke his merits and their sight is restored with his life.

From right to left are a damaged figure, perhaps the jeweller of the story, offering food to a monk holding a staff, and the jeweller again, in chignon and uttarīya, working on a table, below which is the very damaged outline of a large bird. At the doorway of the jeweller's interior the same monk emerges with a staff and bowl. Beyond a tree the jeweller, in chignon, earrings, uttarīya and paridhāna, watches the arrest of the monk by a person in a girt knee-length tunic, trousers and shod feet who stands with his left hand on his hip and his right hand holding perhaps a staff of office (daṇḍa) at shoulder level.
In the next scene the officer of justice (or the jeweller's servant) appears to seize the monk's staff and immediately afterwards he and another in nomad dress assault him: the monk is apparently stripped to his lower garment, one man pinions him by both hands from behind, pushing with a raised knee as he is pulled with a cangue, lasso or halter round his neck by the other who lifts a staff or club while resting one leg on a bird which appears to peck the ground at the monk's feet. Beyond a tree are three figures: the monk, fully dressed again but without his staff and bowl, his hands covered in his robe, is flanked by figures in uttarīya and paridhāna, one joining his hands while the other may hold flowers in his right hand at shoulder level and his left hand on his hip.

The damaged horizontal framing elements are those of BM 1880.54. Foucher, 1917a: 271-81, quotes two Chinese texts ['Aśvaghoṣa Sūtrālaṃkāra' (French translation in Huber, 1908: 321-30) and 'Jing lu yi xiang' (Nanjio 1329 = Taisho IV.203), translated in Chavannes, 1910-34: III, 210-11 (no. 440)] which tell how a bird (a parrot in the 'Jing lu yi xiang' and a goose in 'Aśvaghoṣa')  swallowed a valuable pearl while a monk on his begging round was in a jeweller's shop and its owner was absent fetching him food. Rather than reveal this and cause the bird's death, the monk, while denying his own guilt, preferred to be unjustly accused and beaten by the jeweller until the blood ran. The bird attempted to drink it and was accidentally killed by the blows. The monk then became free to speak, the bird was cut open and the pearl found inside it. In pointing out that this relief is exceptional in representing a theme not connected with the Buddha, Foucher wonders whether, in the version known to the Gandhāra sculptor, the monk might have been one of his particular companions and only very hesitantly connects it with Lahore 119, a fragment showing a monk tied to a post or pillory. Foucher, 1917a: 274, also identifies the first figure as thejeweller by his Roman type of steelyard, but it is not distinguishable in the now damaged feature which even in the early photograph was very abraded and seems only the outstretched hand(s) of the person offering. The activity at the table in Foucher's view is thejeweller's search for the gem swallowed by the bird. Foucher, ibid.: 273, actually believes that the bird is drinking the monk's blood. The supposed Indra lacks headdress, bracelets and necklace. Consequently, Foucher admits that this interpretation is weak.

Between the ship and a diagonal ridge evidently representing the shore is a damaged surface with wavy grooves and the vestiges of two figures, presumably in the water. Just within the shore, beside a small tree, a male in uttarīya and paridhāna, right hand at shoulder level, turns towards two women both facing him in three-quarter view wearing a sleeved tunic, a paridhāna round it and a scarf, one having the scarf over her head, the other a wreath headdress with a protruding loop of hair. The latter gestures towards an oblique doorway with a moulded threshold and moulded architraves, a cavetto cornice with lotus-petal enrichment and a door-panel partly open. Beyond, a male in uttarīya and paridhāna, the left hand holding an end of the uttarīya prominently, the hair with a large chignon, and wearing earrings and a collar (the first male figure repeated), is greeted by four young women dressed like the first two and in various postures: the first grasps the man by his arm, pointing with the other hand to the second door, the second woman and probably the third gesture towards the same door and the last joins her hands; the second door is like the first.

According to the summary List of sculptures from Yusufzai (Cunningham, infra) supplemented by an old photograph, this length, together with 1880.32 on the left, formed the sixth riser on the stair to the main stupa at Jamalgarhi.
It was Foucher who proposed to see in this length part of the Maitrakanyaka jātaka; the hull then represents the ship still intact on the voyage, and on the damaged part between it and the shore Maitrakanyaka struggles landwards on his plank after the shipwreck. The rest of the riser then shows his successive reception by two and four apsarases in front of their respective towns. The other representations of this jātaka show the end of the story: on one short length Maitrakanyaka is received before a door and makes music with a woman before meeting the victim of the wheel, but the other may belong to a series of fragments on which Maitrakanyaka rides a horse at the head of a caravan. The present length is incomplete; 1880.32, its admittedly damaged neighbour on riser 6 according to the photographic record, hardly suggests its continuation, but 1880.43 may have belonged although it cannot have been immediately adjacent. If this is the Mahājanaka jātaka, as was once supposed in the Museum, only the beginning of this length could illustrate the king's son's shipwreck and, doubtfully, his reaching Mithilā, and there is again no obvious connection with the rest of the length or its neighbour 1880.32 .
The Bodhisattva as Maitrakanyaka was a sea-faring merchant's only son who took up his late father's dangerous livelihood; as she clasped his feet to dissuade him, he kicked his mother's head. Shipwrecked on his first voyage, he reached land on a plank and was successively received and entertained in four cities: in the first by four, in the second by eight, in the third by sixteen and in the fourth by thirty-two apsarases. Having escaped their attentions, he reached a city of iron in which a man was undergoing torment as a flaming metal wheel revolved upon his head, the blood, marrow and chyle from it forming his only sustenance. As this was in punishment for disrespect to a mother, the wheel at once came to rest on the Bodhisattva's head and would have long so continued until another, similarly guilty, should come, but the Bodhisattva's readiness to save others by enduring the torment for ever earned him its instant cessation. In the Pāli tradition a merchant's son, Mittavindaka, was cast adrift on a raft to save the ship and met on successive islands female spirits of the dead in numbers increasing by the same geometrical progression before encountering a man with a sharp wheel on his head and taking it on his own. But Mittavindaka was not the Bodhisattva and he was obliged to expiate to the end.",Zwalf 1996 / A Catalogue of the Gandhara Sculpture in the British Museum,Not on display,,"1.Grey schist, broken, chipped and worn.

A number of examples combine the three elements of this piece, the Buddha, a disc on a pedestal and monks, which could stand for the Three Jewels of Buddhism, the Buddha, the Doctrine and the Order. In most instances the disc is, as here, floral or floral with the characteristics of a wheel, but a plain disc with a border of radiate petals is found on a piece now in private hands. Save for here, the Buddha always appears to touch or turn the disc. The combination of these three elements also occurs on a harmikā (San Francisco B60 SI) in succession to the Birth, the Great Departure and Entreaty to Preach and this suggests that the iconography may have served as a variant representation of the First Sermon, especially as one of apparently five monks is carrying a seat of the type discussed in BM 1940.0713.4, where other examples which suggest the same continuous narration are listed. In other instances, like the present, where the cloth may be an offering, no seat is brought. Deer in this connection, as against examples with the three wheels (compare BM 1970.0602.1), appear never to be present.
A disc, lacking any floral aspect and seen as a solar symbol of the Buddha (see BM 1966.1017.2), can occur with what seem to be the knees of the Buddha's crossed legs behind it, perhaps confirming an innovating iconography. In the present case the common overlap between the wheel shown as such and floral discs (compare Foucher, 1905-51: I, 429) may indicate that the Doctrine is indeed to be understood here and that the identity of the Buddha with the Doctrine (Benisti, 1977: 65-6) is further emphasised by the appearance, so far isolated in the present iconography, of his crossed legs behind it while the flanking Buddha in the exceptional abhaya gesture may be in an expository or legitimating role as he is perhaps also, but with a different gesture, on BM 1902.1002.26.

Māyā, with the left leg across the right at the ankles, wears a draped garment from the left shoulder, a paridhāna round it, a scarf which passes behind the back and hangs from both upper arms, a cross-hatched wreath headdress on top of the head, earrings, bracelets, a collar and anklets. The haloed infant in high relief, with uṣṇīṣa, and both arms undercut as they rest on the swaddling cloth, emerges almost to the legs from her right side. Māyā's attendant, who has been identified with Mahāprajāpatī, her sister, wears a sleeved tunic over a paridhāna, a twisted and rounded circular headdress, perhaps of cloth, and the same ornaments and stands slightly inclined, one leg crossing the other below the knees. Another female figure behind her, dressed like Māyā but with a segmented wreath or diadem, brings her right hand to her mouth in astonishment while the left hand holds a cross-hatched palm branch. Indra, opposite, bends forward with an unusually long swaddling cloth above his flexed left leg. His uttarīya is in the wide mode and he wears a collar, earrings and a cylindrical cap with a motif of squares with crossed diagonal lines. All the figures have long oval faces and sharply cut features with rounded protruding eyes. Above them are branches, spreading in the centre and at each side, the leaves symmetrically paired.
The panel is flanked by somewhat broad framing pilasters with sharply cut Corinthian capitals in distinct upper and lower parts, a recessed oblong panel with curved ends top and bottom on each shaft and the usual base mouldings. The centre line is continued vertically in the middle of the framing border below.
In the clockwise direction of worship this face is followed by those described in  1880.227, 1880.227 and 1880.227.
Other one of four faces of a stupa base or harmikā block shows the Assault of Māra.The haloed Bodhisattva sits as on BM 1895.1018.2, except that the over-robe clears his right thigh; the neckline is in somewhat sharp relief, and the grooves defining drapery folds curve across the broad chest. The oval head has sharply cut features and beyond the sharp hairline wavy hair continues into the uṣṇīṣa. The branches above bear clear pipal leaves. The strewn seat has a moulded plinth, plain sides and, on the face, the same motif as on BM 1895.1018.2. On the Bodhisattva's left Māra is about to draw his sword from the scabbard; he wears a paridhāna and a twisted scarf or uttarīya over his left shoulder, a turban with a knot or crest over his left ear, a collar, earrings, armlets and bracelets. Above him is a half-length figure with tousled hair, a grim expression, a sleeved and quilted shirt and perhaps a shield over his left shoulder. On the right is presumably Māra again, the turban knot, since it here appears over the other ear, perhaps intended for the back, and he appears to be stealing away, his hands held before him; his sheathed sword, now between the knees, hangs by a baldrick running from behind the back and though a suspension bridge on the scabbard. Above, another half-length armed figure wears a helmet with a curved brim rising to a point above the forehead.
The third face of a stupa base or harmikā block shows the Entreaty to Preach the Doctrine. The haloed Buddha, hands in dhyāna and covered in the over-robe, wears this garment over both shoulders; the curved neckline is in relief and the grooves for drapery folds are regular and curved except where the robe is over the hands and forearms, and spreads below the hands as if tucked in between the knees. The Buddha's oval face has sharp features almost in a smile and the wavy hair continues into the uṣṇīṣa. His body is broad and the legs and knees crudely large. Above him are one short and two long branches with evenly paired leaves, the long branches with looped garlands; his strewn rectangular seat is unusually low with a simple plinth and a leaf pattern on its face. On the Buddha's left Indra, with hands joined, uttarīya in the narrow mode, wears a now damaged turban, earrings, a collar and bracelets; on the right Brahmā with hands joined, uttarīya across the chest and partly in higher relief, has long hair under a chignon and a horizontal length of hair looped at one end.
The fourth face of the stupa base or harmikā block shows the First Sermon of the Buddha. The haloed Buddha is in abhaya, the left hand rests in the lap and the gathered drapery of the robe spreads onto the seat, while the edges falling on both sides of the right wrist are in prominent relief. A pair of branches with evenly paired leaves, and one branch broken in the middle, form a canopy and on each outer branch hangs a looped floral garland. The Buddha's rectangular strewn seat has a moulded plinth and on its face a triangular motif with indented triangles (stylised opening lotuses alternately inverted). The wheel has twelve spokes. Flanking him obliquely on each side sits a monk with hands in dhyāna covered in the robe, which lies spread with a straight edge between the legs below. The tonsured head of each one is round, sharply cut and with a hairline. Unlike the Buddha's, their seats have a motif of slanting leaves on the face. Behind each monk stands a now headless figure with hands joined: one has a bare right shoulder, the other a variant mode with the right shoulder and upper arm partly covered.",,,,,,,Kushan,2ndC-3rdC,Made in: Gandhara (Pakistan),Found/Acquired: Pakistan,schist,,,carved,"Height: 23.50 centimetres; Width: 34.90 centimetres max. ; Width: 34.30 centimetres min.

The Bodhisattva was born in the Lumbinī Grove as Māyā held a branch of the śāla or plakṣa which the Bodhisattva's glory had caused to bend towards her in salute. His time in the womb fulfilled, he emerged from Māyā's right side, mindful, conscious and undefiled, causing her no pain, and Indra and Brahmā Sahapati received the child, wrapping his every limb with a silken cloth. In the Saṃghabhedavastu Māyā stood beside a flowering aśoka tree as her time came, Indra protected her modesty by scattering the crowd around her with wind and rain, transformed himself into an old nurse and then received the child on a cloth of antelope skin. In the Pāli tradition, too, the child was born as the mother held a branch of a tree, the śāla, which had bent down towards her, and attendants drew a curtain and retired; the child was successively received on different cloths by the four Mahābrahmās, the four mahārājas and by men.
Scenes of the Birth agree in showing Māyā in the centre, right hand raised and grasping a branch (a complete tree seems never to be shown), legs often crossed at the ankles, the infant emerging half-length and sometimes haloed as here from her right side, while on Māyā's left a female supporter stands in a variety of postures, usually holding Māyā whose left arm rests on one or both of her shoulders. Indra, turbaned and sometimes haloed or, as here, with his cylindrical cap, bends forward with a cloth; behind him is often Brahmā with or without one or more figures worshipping, rejoicing or showing surprise. Behind Māyā's assistant a female often stands holding a palm branch or an Indian equivalent of peacock feathers and sometimes she or a second female holds a spouted pot. At the top of the scene, flanking the branches of the tree, are musical instruments.
In the scene of the assault of Māra, two figures of Māra are assumed here according to Foucher's interpretation given in BM 1895.1018.2.

From Whitfield 1985:
Each side of this plaque carries a figure of the Buddha in an identical standing position, the right hand in abhaya-mudra, conferring absence of fear. On the side seen here, he is clad in a red robe, within an oval vesica which has lost all pigment. The details of the face are outlined in red on a white ground, while the folds of the robe are in ink. On the other side (Fig. 95). The Buddha is unclad save for a loin cloth; the hands are in the same mudra. Much of the white pigment has been lost, but a few details such as the vajra on the forearm and the double rings on the upper legs show that this is Vairocana, the Buddha in his cosmic aspect, with various forms (in which he may exist) depicted on, meaning within, his body.
Eiichi Matsumoto, in a series of articles in 1936 (Kokka, nos. 548, 549, 551), was the first to point out the importance of Khotan as a centre of the Avatamsaka Sutra and in its eastward propagation from the fifth century or even earlier until the close of the eighth century. Between A.D. 418 and 421 the first Chinese translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra was made by Buddhabhadra from a Sanskrit version of the sutra obtained from Khotan. More recently, the problems of the iconography of Khotanese Buddhism have been explored by Joanna Williams (1973, pp. 117-24), who was able to find still more examples of the Cosmic Vairocana among the extant remnants of the art of Khotan. Those shown in this volume include a fragment of a wall painting from Khadalik (Pl. 53-4) and a plaque from Farhad-beg-yailaki (Pl. 72), as well as the present example. Still other wall paintings and plaques have been published by Gerd Gropp (1974; see especially pp. 132-33).
The style revealed in these two figures shows little evidence of Chinese influence. The whole of each figure conforms closely to the shallow curves of the surrounding vesica; the legs are almost straight, the arms held close to the sides, the head a large oval with features almost geometrically disposed. In the robed figure of Pl. 71 the drapery lines still echo fairly closely the classical Gandharan arrangement, the left hand holding a loop of robe. At Dunhuang we find more movement even in the figures of the earliest caves, while the first example of the Cosmic Vairocana, from Cave 428 of the Northern Zhou (A.D. 550-57) already shows a more developed type of Vairocana, no longer naked but clad in an ample robe on which are depicted scenes of Mt. Sumeru (Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, Vol. 1, Pl. 162). Thus the sixth century would appear to be the latest possible date for the plaque.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此木板畫的兩面都繪著右手結施無畏印的佛立像。本圖所揭示的面上，佛穿赤褐色衣，有橢圓形頭光，但頭光的顔色幾乎全部殘失。佛的臉部則是在白底上施以紅色的輪廓線，衣褶則用墨綫。背面（Fig. 95）的佛是以布纏腰的裸身，手印與前相同，白色顔料大多已脫落，從前膊的金剛杵及膝蓋上方雙層的輪等特徵可看出是毘廬遮那佛，身上畫著各種形象（其中也包括佛）。
松本榮一博士于1936年發表的一系列論文（《國華》，第548、549、551號）中首次指出了于闐作爲《華嚴經》中心的重要性，以及《華嚴經》的東漸是從5世紀或稍早些到8世紀末。而418年至421年間佛馱跋陀羅首次進行的《華嚴經》漢譯，也是譯自從于闐獲得的梵文經典。對於和田的佛教圖像，近年Joanna Williams進行了調查（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973年，頁117-124），從大量和田繪畫中發現了許多毘廬遮那佛像。本書所舉出的毘廬遮那佛像的作品，除本圖外，還可見於喀達里克的壁畫斷片（圖53－4）以及法哈特伯克亞依拉克（末城）的木板畫（圖72），而在Gerd Gropp的著作（1974年，特別是頁132-133）中還其他壁畫和木板畫的例子。
這兩個圖像在風格上幾乎感覺不到中國影響的因素。身體恰好容在用流暢的線條繪的身光裏，兩腿筆直，兩臂緊貼在身體兩側，橢圓形的頭部幾乎是用幾何圖案處理的。圖71左手所執衣邊的衣紋處理，可看出古典的犍陀羅雕刻殘影。在敦煌，早期石窟造像就有比此有發展的造像。在北周時期（550～557年）的第428窟展示了成熟的毘盧遮那佛造像，不裸身，著衣，衣上還畫有須彌山（參照《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第1卷，圖162）。從上所述，可以考慮此木板畫最遲在6世紀就出現了。; The Department of Asia would like to thank Xanthe Carmichael for her help with updating the information on the site of Dandan-Uiliq.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
This votive plaque was found by Stein in a large cella, 5.4 m by 4.2 m, and surrounded on three sides by a circumambulatory passage 1.8 m wide, behind the square image base. Five more plaques were found along the wall. Vairocana, the supreme Buddha, is recognized by the other images appearing on his body: two seated Buddhas appear on his torso, symbols of the sun and moon on his right and left shoulders, pairs of long rectangles on each upper arm, and a bird on each forearm, besides many double circles. The long rectangles are generally taken to represent the scriptures in the form of pothi. Joanna Williams (1973) has suggested that “the significance of the books on the arms of the Cosmic Vairocana possibly lies in their identification with the Avatamsaka Sutra itself, indicating the unusual importance of the literary basis for the iconography” (p. 123; see the notes to Pl. 71).
The buildings F. Ⅱ at Farhad-beg-yailaki, of which F. Ⅱ. iii formed a part, were thought by Stein to be the living quarters of a small monastery. The coins found at the site were all wushu pieces of the Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220), with no Tang coins, and for this as well as for stylistic reasons Stein concluded that the site had been abandoned at some time between A.D. 519, when the Chinese monk Song Yun described Mocheng (identified with Charchan by Stein; see Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1255), and the end of the sixth century. This conclusion still seems to be a reasonable one: the oval shape of the head and the protruding eyes recall the three dimensional images of the Buddha from Rawak.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此木板畫是斯坦因從三面圍有1.8m寬的走廊5.4m×4.2m的大殿的方型台座背後發現的。在這裏，沿著牆壁還發現了五件木板畫。根據身上畫的各種形象，可確認本圖的像是至高無上的毘盧遮那佛，即軀幹上有兩身坐佛，兩肩上有象徵性的日月，上臂有豎的長方形，前臂上是鳥和小的同心圓。長方形一般是表示梵夾形式的佛典。Joanna Williams則認爲“毘盧遮那佛兩臂上所繪的經本，在圖像學上作爲文獻，可以認爲它就是《華嚴經》”（參照《和田佛教美術圖像》，1973年，123頁）。
斯坦因認爲，末城F. Ⅱ. iii的建築物，是這個小型寺院的生活區。此遺迹發現的貨幣都是東漢末年（25～220年）的五銖錢，沒有唐代的貨幣，從此情況及風格上的特點綜合考慮，斯坦因得出了此遺迹在中國僧人宋雲曾到過末城（斯坦因把記爲末城。參照《西域》，卷3，1255頁）的519年至6世紀末間被遺棄的結論。本圖像的橢圓形頭部和突出的眼睛等，使人想起熱瓦克佛像的立體感，斯坦因的觀點迄今爲止仍是最有說服力的。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

The deity was identified by Stein as the Rat King: according to a legend related by Xuanzang in Da Tang xiyu ji, the king of Khotan was able to defeat an attack by the Xiongnu thanks to golden rats which gnawed the bowstrings and other gear of the latter, and which were consequently worshipped at a shrine west of Khotan. Kumagai Nobuo (1962, p. 102) notes that this plaque links folk legends with Buddhism in a special way not found among the terracottas from Khotan. Joanna Williams (1973, p. 152) considers that it is equally possible that the figure may represent a wolf head as in a votive plaque from Tarishlak (Serindia, Pl. XII) and so one of the grahas, or beings with supernatural influence over the health of children. Another votive plaque (Fig. 96), showing two women each holding a baby, must have been intended to secure protection for them, while one of the six female spirits shown in Vol. 2, Pl. 75 is a wolf-headed figure, identified in the Khotanese inscription as Mukhamanda: this deity, according to the Chinese inscription also on the painting, had to be propitiated in order to protect the child. Thus the question of identification of the middle figure must remain open. The third smaller figure has suffered some abrasion and does not help to resolve the matter.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
此木板畫與《養蠶西漸傳說》的木板畫（圖66）的尺寸大致相同，但是背面也繪著五身小佛像（本書未收錄），其中三身完全消失，剩下的兩身著紫衣，坐在拱形的淡青色背光中。這些像與和田壁畫斷片中數排小千佛像相似。
正面的三像中，二身主尊的像很大。左邊的男像未完成，手持團扇，注視著頭戴寶冠、身穿赤和青衣服的獸頭像。有關此獸頭像，斯坦因根據玄奘《大唐西域記》的故事，判定爲鼠王。此故事是，大群金色的鼠咬斷匈奴的弓弦及其它的裝備，幫助于闐王擊敗匈奴人的襲擊，王在于闐的西邊爲鼠建祠堂進行祭祀。而熊谷宣夫先生（參照〈西域美術〉――《西域文化研究》第5卷，1962，102頁）認爲，此故事不見於和田出土的陶器，體現了民俗故事與佛教相結合的特殊連系。另外，Joanna Williams認爲，“此像如同Tarishlak出土的木板畫（《西域》，圖XII）可能是狼頭，或許是羯羅訶之一，或許是掌管兒童健康的神靈之一”（參照《和田佛教美術圖像》，152頁）。還有繪著兩個婦人各自抱著嬰兒的木板畫（Fig. 96），一定是在祈求兒童的安全。另外，本書第2卷圖75的六身女神像中，有一身的題記為于闐文，據Mukhamanda的解讀，就是狼頭像。而同一畫面上的漢文題記記載為保護兒童，不得不取悅該女神。因而對中間像的判斷仍是需要解決的問題。第三尊小像但由於已磨損，無助於解決問題。; The Department of Asia would like to thank Xanthe Carmichael for her help with updating the information on the site of Dandan-Uiliq.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Tucker 2003 / The Silk Road.

From Whitfield 1985:
This panel was found in the same circumstances as that in the previous plate. Although only about half as long, it is painted in a similar style on the front, and the back is painted as well (Fig. 97). This plate shows the front, with three seated figures all in the characteristic pose looking to their right. The identification of these figures has been put forward by Joanna Williams in the article already quoted in the notes to the preceding plate. She identifies the figure on the left as Indra, crowned and holding a vajra; at the other end could be Brahma, with three (out of four) heads and a third eye in each, holding a bow and arrows and a drinking bowl. The figure in the centre is suggested with less certainty by Williams as a goddess of abundance, in which case this whole group, with the Hindu gods Indra and Brahma might refer to an event such as the Buddha’s birth. The goddess holds aloft the sun and moon, as do some of the other deities in this series of votive panels from Khotan (see Pl. 70-1), and another unidentified attribute.
On the reverse (Fig. 97), two Buddhas are seated in the centre, looking towards one another, one in a red robe, the other in white, with fine drapery lines in ink. At either side sits another figure. That on the left is apparently a Bodhisattva, nude to the waist and wearing red trousers with white floral spots. The corresponding figure on the right is almost completely effaced.; Chinese

From Whitfield 1985:
This is one of the most arresting of the painted wooden plaques found by Stein at Dandan-oilik, all of which owe their fine state of preservation to the fact that they were placed above floor level. D.X at this site was a small cella with wall paintings of rows of small Buddha figures and a single stucco image, nothing of which remained, however, save the octagonal base, waisted in hourglass fashion, with a broad ledge at the bottom for offerings. The plaque was standing on end against one of the facets of the base.
The figures are depicted, as in the fragments of wall painting from Khadalik, with the main features outlined in red, and the upper eyelids and eyebrows in black. Stein recognized the subject as the legend of the introduction of sericulture to Khotan. The central figure is the Chinese princess who, according to Xuanzang (Da Tang xiyu ji, Chapter 12), warned by the envoys that there was no means of raising silkworms or mulberry leaves in Khotan, hid mulberry seeds and the eggs of the silk moth in her headdress (here indicated by the attendant on the left) and smuggled them to Khotan to raise silkworms from them, thereby circumventing the Chinese embargo on their export, which had previously frustrated the king of Khotan’s efforts to obtain the means of making silk. At the border post, the official did not dare to examine her headdress. The resulting cocoons are seen in a basket in front of the princess.
At the far right another figure stands by a loom with stretched warp, holding a beating comb in her hand, like those illustrated in Figs. 34-35. Behind her is an object that may be a reel for thread, and between her and the princess sits a presiding four-armed deity. All these identifications were made by Stein, who also noted the petal-shaped spots of dark pink set around the figures, and compared them to the auspicious sandal-ointment marks used by Hindus. In addition the four-armed god has been identified by N. V.D’ yakonova as a patron of weaving, presiding over the Silk Legend, as on this panel, and occasionally represented separately, as in Pl. 70-2 and another panel in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad (Joanna Williams, 1973, Fig. 63). Still another panel on exhibition in the Hermitage Museum (ibid., Fig. 64) presents the same figures in a vertical composition, with the four-armed god at the top of the panel and below him the princess holding the bowl of cocoons, with a kneeling attendant holding a shuttle (?). Below that, the princess is shown once more, this time with an attendant pointing at her headdress, just as in the Stein panel reproduced here.
Yet another panel brought by Stein from Dandan-oilik, and now in New Delhi (ibid., Fig. 58, and Ancient Khotan, Pl. LXVII), displays a slightly different version of the same subject, which can be seen as an important local legend, of which the panel shown here was the first and is still the finest example.; Chinese
From Whitfield 1985:
斯坦因在丹丹烏里克發現的木板畫中，此繪畫是最爲引人注目的作品，由於是放在地板上，保存狀態極好。發現它的丹丹烏里克D.X寺址，是一個有數層千佛壁畫以及一身塑像的小屋。現在塑像已沒有了，只剩下中間細的漏斗狀八角形台座，下面曾有放供物的寬架子，此木板畫正好靠放在台座的一面。
臉部與喀達里克壁畫的斷片一樣，主要輪廓線用紅色描繪，上瞼和眉毛上加了墨色。斯坦因認爲，此主題與養蠶技術傳到于闐的傳說故事有關。主要人物是中國公主，據玄奘的《大唐西域記》（12章）記載，于闐過去沒有桑葉，也沒有蠶，于闐王命令使者去求得桑葉和蠶，但中國禁止帶出國外。於是，她便將桑種和繭藏在頭飾中（左邊的侍女正在指著），嫁到于闐。國境的關卡不可能查到頭飾，計劃順利成功。從此于闐開始養蠶，公主前面的籃子裏盛滿了繭。
站在撐滿經線的織機旁右端的像，右手拿著與Figs. 34-35展示的相同的筬。她後邊放著紡車樣的器械，她和公主中間坐著四臂神像。斯坦因對以上進行過比定，也進一步對散落于諸像周邊的暗紅色花瓣形裝飾，和印度教的塗白檀香的吉祥標誌做了比較。另外，N. V.D’ yakonova將四臂神像與掌管養蠶的編織守護神作了比定，圖70－2和艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的另外的一塊木板畫（參照Joanna Williams《和田佛教美術圖像》，Fig. 63），是作爲獨立像描繪的。而陳列于艾爾米塔什美術館的有另外一塊木板畫，內容是縱向排列的（同上，參照Fig. 64），最上部繪著四臂像，其下是手持盛繭容器的公主和手捧梭樣器械跪著的侍女，最下段描繪的公主和指向其頭飾的侍女的樣子，與本圖木板畫中的一樣。
同樣，斯坦因從丹丹烏里克所獲現藏新德里國立博物館一塊木板畫（同上，參照Fig. 58及《古代和田》圖版LXVII）也繪有相同主題，但其表現形式略有变化，可以視爲當地的一個重要傳説。此木板畫較本圖所示的年代早，而且更爲精美。; The Department of Asia would like to thank Xanthe Carmichael for her help with updating the information on the site of Dandan-Uiliq.","Stein 1907 / Ancient Khotan: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Chinese Turkestan; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

From Whitfield 1985:
The first three of these fragments are all from a large square shrine at Khadalik from which Stein recovered many manuscripts and fragments of wall painting (the largest section of painted wall with stencilled Buddhas from the cella of this shrine is shown among the text figures to the Introduction of Vol. 1). The fourth piece is also from Khadalik, but its exact position on the site is not known. The site was abandoned towards the end of the eighth century, as established by Stein from finds of coins at the site (see Serindia, Vol. I, p. 159).
Although the figure of Ganesa is somewhat coarsely drawn, the other figures are finely delineated. The head of the Buddha in particular may be compared to a larger fragment (see Serindia, Pl. XI, Kha. i. C. 0097) from the centre of the shrine. Although this larger fragment, which is still in the British Museum, has suffered considerably since its reproduction by Stein, the plate in Serindia shows both the splendour of the original composition and the way in which it was related to small seated figures of the Buddha, alternating in background colour. The Buddha is seated with hands in the teaching mudra; his lotus throne has two rows of fleshy petals, symmetrically disposed. Behind him is a mandorla of stylized flames. On either side stand tall Bodhisattvas, swaying at the waist slightly towards the Buddha, the legs very stiff and straight. Their form is close to that of the individual Bodhisattvas of Vol. 1, Pls. 46-48, and the stance recurs much later in most of the paintings found by Kozlov at Kharakhoto and now in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad (cf. Dieux et demons de l’ Himalaya, Nos.22-23, p. 77ff). Small seated Buddhas, all with their heads slightly inclined in three-quarters view, surround the whole composition, which thus appears as a Buddha triad on a ground of regularly alternating smaller figures, on a smaller scale but with the same organization as that to be found in the Sui and Tang caves at Dunhuang. Joanna Williams (1973,p. 110) has pointed out how important this fragment is, since it “connects a variety of types of image which are usually preserved only in fragments.”
Another sizeable fragment, Kha. i. E. 0058. c, unfortunately not reproduced here or in Serindia, has four of the small Buddhas with colours well preserved: white and red alternate in the mandorlas and ground, with occasional nimbi or mandorlas of purplish pink, while the Buddha’s robe may be red, black brown or white. Each is seated on a flat-topped padmasana with down-turned petals. The main facial features are outlined in red, but the pupils, upper eyelids and eyebrows are in ink. The two small fragments shown in Fig. 42 are of this type. (Figure 49, though a wooden plaque and not a wall painting, shows the correct angle at which the head was inclined; a single larger head, Kha. i. 0054,is reproduced in Serindia, Pl. XI.) The few drapery lines are in ink and occasionally accented in white, but on the whole the painters seem to have preferred the use of areas of colour without outline, so that the figures have a simple solidity. No lines are ruled between the Buddhas, the frame for each being established by the simple counterchange of colours in the ground.
Among the other fragments shown in the monochrome figures, Fig. 44 displays brilliant colours: the bodhisattva, presumably Avalokitesvara since he holds a flask, wears azure trousers; his body, outlined in red, is pink against a bright green mandorla with broad brown and red borders. The small figure nearby appears to be a donor. Plate 53-4 shows some of the same blue, less brilliant in reproduction than in the original, combined with delicate outlines and subtle green and pink shades, in a fragment of the Cosmic Vairocana with the sun disc on his shoulder and a vajra on the forearm (cf. Pl. 72 and Figs. 50, 95). Such pieces afford a mere glimpse of the wealth and quality of Khotanese painting, and it is interesting that one fragment (Fig. 43) shows a hand grasping a writing brush: the handle is of wood, with a close binding and slightly swelling bundle of hairs at the end.; Chinese

前三件都是從喀達里克的大方形寺址攜來的斷片，斯坦因從那裏還發現了許多文書類和壁畫斷片（寺院内殿用模板繪的千佛壁畫，刊載於本書第1卷的《導言》部分的插圖中）。第四張斷片也是從喀達里克發現的，但不知是否在這個寺址出土的。斯坦因據在此地發現的硬幣推斷，此遺迹可能是8世紀結束時廢棄的（參照《西域》159頁）。

這些主尊群的周圍，配有略向前傾的小佛坐像，這看來恰似佛三尊突出在有規則地分配小佛像的背景中。此小佛群，規模雖小，但讓人想起敦煌隋唐窟中所見千佛的結構。Joanna Williams也指出，此斷片的重要性，就在於各個零七八碎很難拼合的斷片上，能看出像與像間的相互關係（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973，110頁）。
此外，《西域》中沒有收錄，遺憾的是本書選材時也遺漏了的，還有色彩保存較好的四身小佛的略大些的斷片Kha.i.E.0058.c。那斷片上，身光和底色交替搭配著白和紅色，紅色時而在頭光上，時而又用在身光上。而佛的衣服爲紅、黑、茶、白等色，都坐在平坦的覆瓣蓮花座上。臉部的主要部分用朱線描繪，瞼和眉毛使用了黑色。Fig. 42展示的兩塊斷片與此是同類作品（收錄於《西域》圖版XI的繪有佛頭的斷片Kha.i.0054，也是與此同類的作品。另外，本書Fig. 49，雖然是板繪而不是壁畫，但前側向的臉部表現與此相同）。衣紋線使用黑色，偶爾用白色來突出，大概是畫家比較喜歡省略輪廓線而以色面來表現，佛像具有一點立體感。各小佛坐像間沒有分界線，只是調換每個像框的底色來體現。
黑白圖版展示的壁畫斷片中，Fig. 44可見有美麗的色彩：從手持淨瓶判斷是觀音菩薩，身著淡青色衣裙，有紅色輪廓的肉身上染了淡紅色，與有茶和紅色寬邊的亮綠色背光形成鮮明的對比。近處的小像可能是供養人。圖53－4中，可見精細的輪廓線和淡紅的暈染，有美麗的淡綠和青的色彩。一個斷片為肩有日輪、前臂有金剛的毗盧遮那佛(參見圖72 及 Figs. 50, 95)，從這些壁畫的斷片，可窺到和田壁畫的興盛及其品質的一端，而描繪著手握毛筆的一個斷片(Fig. 43)也是饒有意義的。那筆的桿是木製的，略有些蓬鬆的毛束被牢固地捆在一起。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.

此外，《西域》中沒有收錄，遺憾的是本書選材時也遺漏了的，還有色彩保存較好的四身小佛的略大些的斷片Kha.i.E.0058.c。那斷片上，身光和底色交替搭配著白和紅色，紅色時而在頭光上，時而又用在身光上。而佛的衣服爲紅、黑、茶、白等色，都坐在平坦的覆瓣蓮花座上。臉部的主要部分用朱線描繪，瞼和眉毛使用了黑色。Fig. 42展示的兩塊斷片與此是同類作品（收錄於《西域》圖版XI的繪有佛頭的斷片Kha.i.0054，也是與此同類的作品。另外，本書Fig. 49，雖然是板繪而不是壁畫，但前側向的臉部表現與此相同）。衣紋線使用黑色，偶爾用白色來突出，大概是畫家比較喜歡省略輪廓線而以色面來表現，佛像具有一點立體感。各小佛坐像間沒有分界線，只是調換每個像框的底色來體現。
黑白圖版展示的壁畫斷片中，Fig. 44可見有美麗的色彩：從手持淨瓶判斷是觀音菩薩，身著淡青色衣裙，有紅色輪廓的肉身上染了淡紅色，與有茶和紅色寬邊的亮綠色背光形成鮮明的對比。近處的小像可能是供養人。圖53－4中，可見精細的輪廓線和淡紅的暈染，有美麗的淡綠和青的色彩。一個斷片為肩有日輪、前臂有金剛的毗盧遮那佛(參見圖72 及 Figs. 50, 95)，從這些壁畫的斷片，可窺到和田壁畫的興盛及其品質的一端，而描繪著手握毛筆的一個斷片(Fig. 43)也是饒有意義的。那筆的桿是木製的，略有些蓬鬆的毛束被牢固地捆在一起。","Stein 1921a / Serindia: detailed report of archaeological explorations in Central Asia and Westernmost China; Whitfield 1985 / Textiles, Sculpture and Other Arts; Whitfield & Farrer 1990 / Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.
